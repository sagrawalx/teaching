<h1 id="reading-assignments">Reading Assignments</h1>
<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>Each reading assignment has several parts:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Read some material from the textbook. The reading from [<a
href="https://matthbeck.github.io/complex.html">BMPS</a>] is required.
The reading from [Nee] is optional but highly recommended.</p></li>
<li><p>Attempt the “Comprehension Check” (CC) exercises listed below.
The numbers refer to the “Exercises” from [<a
href="https://matthbeck.github.io/complex.html">BMPS</a>]. You’ll get
credit for <em>sincere attempts</em> and you don’t need to get answers
correct. Submit your attempts through Gradescope: (a) scan your
assignment as a PDF, either using a scanner on campus or one of many
smartphone apps (eg, Genius Scan); and then, (b) follow <a
href="https://help.gradescope.com/article/ccbpppziu9-student-submit-work#submitting_a_pdf">these
instructions</a> to upload. In particular, please make sure to “Assign
Pages” correctly (it’ll only take you a few seconds, but it saves a
significant amount of time on the grading side).</p></li>
<li><p>Participate on Discord in a way that shows that you sincerely
engaged with the reading. Here is a non-exhaustive list of ways you
might show that you engaged with the reading:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask a question about something you didn’t understand in the
reading.</li>
<li>Share a CC problem you had trouble with, including something about
your attempt and where you think your attempt goes wrong.</li>
<li>Answer a question that someone else has asked.</li>
<li>Describe something you found confusing at first but then managed to
figure out.</li>
<li>Share something “from real life” (news, social media, books, comics,
jokes, etc) that’s related to the reading, with an explanation of how
it’s related.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, logistical questions about the class (for example)
do not show that you engaged with the reading.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="w1tue">Week 1, Tuesday</h2>
<ul>
<li>Topic: Complex Numbers<br />
</li>
<li>Read: [<a href="https://matthbeck.github.io/complex.html">BMPS</a>],
Chapter 1</li>
<li>CC: 1.1(a,b), 2(b,c), 3(a,b), 4(a,b), 5(a,b), 11(a), 23(a,b), 29,
33(a)</li>
<li>Optional: [Nee], Sections 1.I–III
<ul>
<li><p>In Section 1.II, Needham writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Surprisingly, many authors [define] <span
class="math inline">\(e^{i\theta}\)</span>, out of the blue, <em>to
be</em> <span class="math inline">\((\cos \theta + i\sin
\theta)\)</span>)! This gambit is logically unimpeachable, but it is
also a low blow to Euler, reducing one of his greatest achievements to a
mere tautology.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is precisely the “gambit” employed by [<a
href="https://matthbeck.github.io/complex.html">BMPS</a>]. If you find
yourself unsettled by this, you will find Needham’s discussion in
Section 1.II interesting.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="w1wed">Week 1, Wednesday</h2>
<ul>
<li>Topic: Continuity and Differentiation</li>
<li>Read: [<a href="https://matthbeck.github.io/complex.html">BMPS</a>],
Sections 2.1–2 and 2.4<br />
</li>
<li>CC: 2.1, 2, 8, 12, 15, 29</li>
<li>Optional: [Nee], Sections 2.I–II, 3.II.4 (“Let us begin… call it an
<em>isogonal mapping</em>.”), 4.I–VII.2, 5.IV, 5.V.1, 5.V.3
<ul>
<li>There is a brief reference to Möbius transformations (the topic of
your next reading) in 4.IV.3; skip that bit for now. There’s a brief
reference to logarithms at the beginning of 5.IV; skip that for now
too.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="w1thu">Week 1, Thursday</h2>
<ul>
<li>Topic: Möbius Transformations</li>
<li>Read: [<a href="https://matthbeck.github.io/complex.html">BMPS</a>],
Sections 3.1–3
<ul>
<li>The “immediate application of proposition 2.11 on p. 35 was exercise
2.15 from your last CC. In example 3.5, it may be true that theorem
3.4”implies” that <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> maps the unit
circle to the real line, but it might benefit you to try to convince
yourself from the formula that the book derives for <span
class="math inline">\(f(e^{i\phi})\)</span> that every real number is a
possible output.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>CC: 3.1, 6, 9(a,b), 14, 21(b,c), 24, 26</li>
<li>Optional: [Nee], Sections 3.I–II.5, 3.IV–V
<ul>
<li>The discussion of inversion in 3.II is very enlightening. 3.V.3 will
only be accessible if you’ve seen some group theory. You might also go
back and take a look at 4.IV.3 again, now that you know what a Möbius
transformation is.</li>
</ul></li>

<h2 id="w1fri">Week 1, Friday</h2>
<ul>
<li>Topic: Sequences and Series</li>
<li>Read: [<a href="https://matthbeck.github.io/complex.html">BMPS</a>],
Chapter 7 and Section 8.1 up through corollary 8.6
<ul>
<li>Skip Example 7.21, Propositions 7.27 and 7.37, the proofs of Theorem
8.1 and 8.2, and Examples 8.3 and 8.4 for now. Try reading through
“elementary” proofs of theorems 8.1 and 8.2 (eg, <a
href="https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Radius_of_Convergence_of_Derivative_of_Complex_Power_Series">here</a>
and <a
href="https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Derivative_of_Complex_Power_Series">here</a>).</li>

<h2 id="w2tue">Week 2, Tuesday</h2>
<ul>

<li>Optional: [Nee], Sections 1.II, 2.IV–V, 5.VII-VIII</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="w2wed">Week 2, Wednesday</h2>
<ul>
<li>Topic: Logarithms</li>
<li>Read: [<a href="https://matthbeck.github.io/complex.html">BMPS</a>],
Section 3.5
<ul>
<li>Example 7.21 will also be accessible now.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>CC: 3.40, 41(c, e, f), 44(c), 45(a, b, h)</li>
<li>Optional: [Nee], 2.VI-VII, 4.VII.3, 5.II–III, 5.VI
<ul>
<li><p>If you do <em>one</em> of the optional readings from [Nee], this
is the one you should do. The discussion of branch points and
multifunctions is very useful. Here’s a comment from 2.VI:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We end with an important observation on the use of “<span
class="math inline">\(e^z\)</span>” to denote the single-valued
exponential mapping… [We] define <span class="math inline">\(f(z) =
k^z\)</span> to be the “multifunction” <span class="math inline">\(f(z)
= e^{z \log(k)}\)</span>. But if we now put <span
class="math inline">\(k = e = 2.718...\)</span> then we are suddenly in
hot water: the exponential mapping “<span
class="math inline">\(e^z\)</span>” is merely one branch [what are the
others?] of the newly defined multifunction <span
class="math inline">\((2.718...)^z\)</span>. To avoid this confusion,
some authors always write the exponential mapping as <span
class="math inline">\(\exp(z)\)</span>. However, we shall retain the
notation “<span class="math inline">\(e^z\)</span>”, which is both
convenient and rooted in history, with the understanding that <span
class="math inline">\(e^z\)</span> always refers to the single-valued
exponential mapping, and never to the multifunction <span
class="math inline">\((2.718...)^z\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="w2thu">Week 2, Thursday</h2>
<ul>
<li>Topic: Path Integrals</li>
<li>Read: [<a href="https://matthbeck.github.io/complex.html">BMPS</a>],

<li>CC: 1(a–c), 3, 4, 5(a–c), 16</li>
<li>Optional: [Nee], Sections 8.I–IX
<ul>
<li>There’s some nice discussion of the geometry of path integrals here,
and “in chapter 11 we will use an entirely different approach to obtain
a second, less strenuous, means of visualizing complex integrals. We
will thereby make a double fallacy of an assertion that is to be found
in most texts—asuming they even consider it worthy of note!—namely, that
complex integrals possess <em>no</em> geometric interpretation.”</li>

\infty\)</span>. It’s only the former that’ll be relevant for
8.36(b).</li>
