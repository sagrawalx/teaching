<blockquote>
<p>… imaginäre Wurzeln als feine und wunderbare Zuflucht des göttlichen
Geistes, beinahe ein Zwitterwesen zwischen Sein und Nichtsein.</p>
<p>… imaginary numbers are a fine and wonderful refuge of the divine
spirit, almost an amphibian between being and non-being.<br />
<span class="blockquote-attribution">—Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz
(1702)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<h3 id="content">Content</h3>
<p>This course is an introduction to complex analysis, the branch of
mathematics which studies complex numbers and their functions. In spite
of the mysticism with which complex numbers were once viewed (eg, by
Leibniz in the quote above), they have important applications to and
connections with a wide variety of other disciplines, including
algebraic geometry, number theory, quantum mechanics, electrical
engineering, and more.</p>
<p>Topics we will cover include: the geometry and arithmetic of the
complex numbers, holomorphic functions and the Cauchy-Riemann equations,
Möbius transformations, power series and analyticity, the complex
exponential and logarithms, path integrals, Cauchy’s theorem, Cauchy’s
integral formula, and residues.</p>
<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
<p>The course will assume that you are able to compose formal
mathematical proofs (MA251), and that you have a working knowledge of
calculus and real analysis (MA126–127, MA204, MA375). On a few
occasions, some facility with linear algebra (MA220) may also be useful.
If you are uncertain about whether or not you meet these prerequisites,
feel free to get in touch!</p>
<h3 id="course-structure-philsophy">Course Structure Philsophy</h3>
<p>In the long run, more important than learning any particular piece of
math is learning how to learn math independently (in pedagogical jargon,
that’s “how to be a <em>self-regulated learner</em> of math”). Research
shows that the following three things are key aspects of this:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><em>Active reading</em>. Reading math is very different from
other kinds of reading. You cannot read a math textbook the same way
you’d read a novel for pleasure if you want to get anything out of it.
You have to stop constantly as you’re reading math. Try to work out
examples yourself, instead of just reading through them. Doodle pictures
to make sure you have some kind of a picture in your head of what’s
going on. Formulate <em>precise</em> questions about things you don’t
understand.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Reciprocal teaching</em>. Talking to your peers about math is
incredibly important. If you don’t understand a particular concept and
ask your peers, you’re much more likely to get an explanation that you
actually find helpful. If you think you do understand a particular
concept and help a peer who’s struggling, you’ll almost certainly find
that the process of explaining the concept to your peer will solidify
your own understanding of it.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Metacognition</em>. A key part of learning how to learn is
reflecting on your learning and taking the time to ask yourself
questions about your learning. What parts of your study habits are
working well for you? What parts aren’t working and how can you change
these parts?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>All three of these are built into the way the course is structured,
and it would benefit you to bear these things in mind as you go through
the course.</p>
<h2 id="course-materials">Course Materials</h2>
<h3 id="textbook">Textbook</h3>
<p>The required textbook for the course is freely available: <a
href="https://matthbeck.github.io/complex.html"><em>A First Course in
Complex Analysis</em></a>, Version 1.54, by Beck, Marchesi, Pixton, and
Sabalka.</p>
<p>Optional, but highly recommended, is Needham’s <em>Visual Complex
Analysis</em>. It contains some immensely useful discussions to help
develop geometric intuition alongside interesting historical
vignettes.</p>
<h3 id="discord">Discord</h3>
<p>There is a <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a> server for our
class. This will be a (virtual) space for you to ask and answer
questions about course content, to socialize, and whatever else seems
appropriate to you. I will also use Discord to make class-related
announcements. You can install Discord on your computer or phone, or you
can use it in a web browser.</p>
<h2 id="course-mechanics">Course Mechanics</h2>
<h3 id="assignments">Assignments</h3>
<p>There will be a few different types of assignments in the course. All
assignments are due at 8am on the day indicated on the <a
href="index#calendar">calendar</a>. This will likely mean that you have
to complete the assignment the day before the deadline indicated on the
calendar. Barring extreme circumstances, deadlines will be strict and
late assignments will not be accepted.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="read">Reading Assignments</a>: These daily assignments
will involve reading some sections from the textbook, attempting some
exercises, and participating the class Discord channel.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="reflect">Reflection Assignments</a>: There will be
roughly 1–2 of these a week and they will ask you to reflect on various
aspects of your relationship with mathematics, your mathematical
learning, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="#quizzes">Quizzes</a>: See below.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="project">Project</a>: There will be a final project, due
at the end of the block.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="in-class-structure">In-Class Structure</h3>
<p>I’ll begin class with a very brief discussion of the latest reading.
This is not intended to be a substitute for having done the reading
assignment! Instead, my goal will just be to briefly refresh your memory
about the reading. We’ll spend most of class time working on
problems.</p>
<h3 id="quizzes">Quizzes</h3>
<p>There will be three take-home, but time-restricted, quizzes.</p>
<p>You may use the textbook and your own notes. You are allocated 2
hours to work on the quiz. You will access the quiz through Gradescope,
and the quiz will be due either by 8am on Tuesday, or within 4 hours of
when you first access the quiz, <em>whichever comes first</em>. This
deadline will be strictly enforced, so please make sure you get quizzes
done and submitted on time.</p>
<p>I entrust to the <a href="#honor-code">Honor Code</a> that: (a) You
will only spend the allocated 2 hours working on the quiz. Gradescope’s
4 hour limit is set only so that you have time to print and/or scan
materials, or in case you have arranged for extra time accommodations
with Accessibility Resources. (b) You will not use any unauthorized
resources (friends, the internet, other textbooks, etc). (c) You will
not share information about the quiz with classmates before they’ve
taken it.</p>
<p>There will also be an opportunity for revisions on the first two
quizzes (but not on the third), giving you the chance to earn back up to
10% of the maximum number of points on the quiz. After the quiz is
graded, figure out what you did wrong on any of the problems you missed
points on. Then stop by my office hours on Wednesday afternoon and talk
to me about what you did wrong and how you’d correct it. I may ask you
some follow-up questions during our conversation to make sure you
understand your revision.</p>
<h2 id="assessment">Assessment</h2>

<p>Here are further details about some of these components:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Daily Discord</em>. You get 1 point for each day that you
post to Discord for the <a href="read">reading assignments</a>, up to a
maximum of <span class="math inline">\(n-2\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the number of days a reading is
assigned. In other words, you don’t need to post every day to get full
credit, and there’s no extra credit for doing so.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Comprehension Checks</em>. You get 1 point for each CC
problem you attempt from the <a href="read">reading assignments</a>, up
to a maximum of <span class="math inline">\(n-10\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the total number of comprehension
check problems that are assigned. In other words, you don’t need to
submit comprehension checks every day to get full credit, and there’s no
extra credit for doing so.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Participation</em>. You’ll get a full score for the
participation component of your grade if you show me somehow that you’re
putting in a good faith effort to engage with the class.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="accommodations">Accommodations</h2>
<p>If you anticipate or experience any disability-related barriers to
your learning in this course, please contact the office of <a
href="https://www.coloradocollege.edu/offices/accessibilityresources/">Accessibility
Resources</a> right away and have them send me an official letter
detailing what accommodations you require.</p>
<h2 id="covid-19">Covid-19</h2>
<p>To protect the health of our community, masking is required in
class.</p>
<p>The class is set up so that you’ll be able to submit everything you
need to submit remotely, in case you find yourself need to isolate. You
should also prepare for the possibility of your isolation by making sure
you have contact information for a few students in class who can share
their class notes with you. If you’d like to attend class virtually
during your isolation, let me know an I’ll work with tech to set this
up, but it’s possible that it might take a couple of days for this to
happen so you should make sure you have a support network among your
classmates.</p>
<p>If you find yourself faced with a different Covid-related situation
that might affect your classwork, please let me know and I’ll do my best
to accommodate your situation. Also know that a variety of offices on
campus are available to help you through difficult situations. For
instance, you might get in touch with the <a
href="https://www.coloradocollege.edu/offices/counseling/">Counseling
Center</a>, or with <a
href="https://www.coloradocollege.edu/offices/campussafety/">Campus
Safety</a>. You can find more information and resources on the <a
href="https://www.coloradocollege.edu/other/coronavirus/">Coronavirus
Updates &amp; Resources page</a>.</p>
<h2 id="honor-code">Honor Code</h2>
<p>Please make sure that you are familiar with the <a
href="https://www.coloradocollege.edu/other/honorcouncil/resources/student.html">Honor
Code</a> at CC. Violations of the Honor Code will have to be reported to
the Honor Council, which is really no fun for anyone.</p>
