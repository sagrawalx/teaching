> And what are these fluxions? The velocities of evanescent increments? And what are these same evanescent increments? They are neither finite quantities, nor quantities infinitely small, nor yet nothing. May we not call them ghosts of departed quantities?

> Although the whole of this life were said to be nothing but a dream and the physical world nothing but a phantasm, I should call this dream or phantasm real enough, if, using reason well, we were never deceived by it.

## Overview

MA126 is an introduction to calculus, the branch of mathematics that studies rates of change and areas. It appeared in its modern form in the 1600s, independently in the works of Gottfried Leibniz and of Isaac Newton. It led to dramatic advances within mathematics itself, and has also found widespread applicability throughout science, engineering, and economics.

## Course Structure Philosophy

I'm interested in applying evidence-based educational techniques in the classroom. One such system that I've experimented with before and found to be quite effective is called *peer instruction*. It was pioneered by the physicist Eric Mazur at Harvard, and is predicated on the observation that *information transfer* (listening to lectures or reading books) is easier than *information assimilation* (solving problems and explaining concepts to others). So, the idea is to move as much information transfer as possible *out* of the classroom (ie, to minimize the time spent listening to lectures), and as much information assimilation as possible *into* the classroom (ie, to maximize the time spent solving problems and explaining concepts to each other). There's a growing body of data that suggests this format is quite effective: by a certain metric, it seems to lead to an improvement in conceptual understanding over more traditional methods by over a factor of 2!

Students explaining concepts to each other is a key component of successful education. If you're struggling to understand something, often an explanation from one of your classmates can be very useful (your classmates are more likely to understand precisely what you're struggling with, since they probably struggled with the same thing not that long ago). Conversely, if you've already managed to understand something, explaining it to a student who's struggling can really help solidify your understanding. The peer instruction model builds in discussion among students inside the classroom. I *strongly* encourage all of you to discuss concepts with each other outside of class as well.

## Course Mechanics

On the course [webpage](/teaching/fa18-b3_ma126), you'll find a calendar that looks like this:

<table style="width: 100%">
<tr>
<th style="width: 10%;">Day</th>
<th style="width: 20%;">Topic</th>
<th style="width: 35%;">Reading assignment</th>
<th style="width: 35%;">Problem set</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td rowspan="2">A</td>
<td>B</td>
<td>C</td>
<td>D</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td colspan="3">E</td>
</tr>
</table>

This means that, on day A, we will be discussing topic B in class. You will want to prepare for this by doing reading assignment C *before* class. After class, you should be ready to tackle the problem set D. In E, you'll find information about any afternoon events and deadlines that will occur on day A. More details follow.

### Reading assignments

The reading assignments have two parts: reading some sections from of the book, and then doing a few exercises to help establish a basic understanding of the concepts introduced in those sections.

To show that you did the reading assignment, you'll use an online form to submit a question that you have about the reading, and to indicate that you have completed the exercises associated with the reading assignment. For the day A reading assignment, you'll submit this form before 11:59pm the night *before* day A, and then you'll submit a hard copy of the exercises at the beginning of class on day A.

A few thoughts about these submissions:

* You might be asking, "What if I don't have any questions about the reading?!" That's fine. You can submit a non-question instead. For example, you might decide to send me a question that you had, but then you managed to figure out, either by yourself or by asking someone for help. Or you might send me something that you understand but you think one of your peers might find confusing. I'm mostly looking for an indication that you read the assigned reading and made a sincere attempt to process it.

* Remember that you don't necessarily need to wait till the night before day A to work on and submit the reading assignment for day A. You're strongly encouraged to get ahead.

* I'll do my best to tailor our in-class discussions to address as many of your questions as I can. The earlier you send me your question, the more likely I am to be able to work it into our discussions. If I don't address your question in class or via email, please find me during office hours and ask again!

* I'll check your solutions to the reading assignment exercises only for completeness. They'll always be odd-numbered problems, and you're encouraged to check your answers to the reading assignment exercises in the back of the book.

### In-class structure

I'll begin class with a very brief discussion of the reading. This is not intended to be a substitute for having done the reading. Instead, the idea is to refresh your memory about what we'll be discussing in class today by working through an couple of examples.

We'll spend most of class time solving problems in the following format.

* I'll put a problem on the board.
* You'll think about the problem by yourself for a couple of minutes.
* We'll vote on an answer to the problem.
* You'll have a few minutes to talk to your classmates about the problem.
* We'll vote again.
* I'll tell you how I'd solve the problem.

Finally, the end of class will be more open-ended. You'll have a little bit of time to ask me or your classmates to help you with whatever you're struggling on.

### Problem sets

After class, you will hopefully be ready to tackle the problem set listed in the fourth column of the calendar. These problem sets will be due in batches 4 times throughout the block. Only the problems that are multiples of 4 will be graded, but it is strongly recommended that you do all of them. Practice is the name of the game!

## Assessment

Grades will be calculated as follows.

--------------------- ------
Reading assignments   10%
Problem sets          15%
Writing assignment    5%
Quizzes               30%
Final exam            25%
Poster project        10%
Participation         5%
--------------------- ------

Here are some details about each of the components of your grade.

* Every reading assignment you submit is worth up to 2 points: 1 for the question, 1 for the exercises. The reading assignments component of your grade will be the total number of points you accumulate in this way, out of a maximum of $2(n-2)$ points, where $n$ is the total number of reading assignments assigned. In other words, you don't need to do submit both things every day to get a perfect score for this component of your grade.

* Problem sets will be collected in batches on quiz/exam days. Only the problems that are multiples of 4 will be graded (a random subset will be graded for correctness, and you'll get completion points for the rest).  

    We'll also do a "zombie project" in the middle of the block. It'll count as a problem set.

* There will be a short writing assignment towards the beginning of the block. You'll find more details on the [webpage](/teaching/fa18-b3_ma126).

* There will be three quizzes during the block. They will take place in the afternoons (see the calendar on the course [webpage](/teaching/fa18-b3_ma126) for the dates and times). There will be some free response questions, and some true-false questions. No books, notes, or electronic devices will be permitted.

    A day or two after the quiz, I'll block off a couple of hours in the afternoons for "quiz revisions." During this time, you can come by and meet with me one-on-one to discuss up to 2 of the true-false questions that you left blank. If you convince me that you now fully understand the solution, you'll get points for that question.

    If you know that you won't be able to to make it to a quiz, please reach out to me as soon as possible!

* The final exam will be on the fourth Tuesday, at the usual class time. The format will be similar to that of quizzes 1 and 2, except that the final will be longer than the quizzes, and there won't be any "revisions."

    If your score on the final exam is higher than your lowest quiz score, I'll use the final exam score to replace the lowest quiz score.

* There will be a poster session on the last day of class. You'll have to put together a poster about a topic related to calculus. You'll find more details on the [webpage](/teaching/fa18-b3_ma126).

* You'll get a full score for the participation component of your grade as long as I am able to see that you are putting in a good faith effort to engage with the class. If at any point during the block I think that you might not get a full participation score, I'll reach out and let you know what you need to be doing to get a full participation score.

## Accommodations

If you anticipate or experience any disability-related barriers to your learning in this course, please discuss your concerns with me as soon as possible and we'll find a way to provide the accommodations that you need. Also, please contact the office of [Accessibility Resources](https://www.coloradocollege.edu/offices/accessibilityresources/) if you have not done so already.

## Honor code

Please make sure that you are familiar with the [Honor Code](https://www.coloradocollege.edu/other/honorcouncil/) at CC. Violations of the Honor Code will have to be reported to the Honor Council, which is really no fun for anyone.

## Advice

* *Mens sana in corpore sano*. It is very challenging to get caught up after being ill, especially on the block plan. I encourage you to make sure that you're getting enough sleep, that you're eating well, and that you're staying physically active. Take care of yourself!
* If you do happen to get sick, please stay home to avoid getting your classmates sick, and let me know so that we can figure out how you'll make up class work.
* The structure of this class will require you to be proactive about your learning. If you need help developing good study habits, please ask me for help and I'll be happy to help.
* Reading math can be challenging: you have to read slowly, and pause constantly to ask yourself if you really understood the last sentence you just read.
