# Resources

There are many resources that cover essentially the same material that we'll be discussing from Gallian's textbook, including many freely available ones. You may very well find that you understand some (or all) topics better from a resource other than Gallian. That's totally fine; seek out and use what works for you!

## Judson's Open Source Textbook

Judson's freely available textbook [*Abstract Algebra: Theory and Applications*](http://abstract.ups.edu/) covers essentially everything we'll be discussing. The development of the theory is almost identical (the order differs only slightly, and some things that are stated and proved as theorems in one book might be left as exercises in the other). Equivalences between chapters of Gallian and sections of Judson are tabulated below.

## Other Resources

If you encounter other resources that you personally find useful, please share them with me! I'll review them and add them to the list below. Things I'd be especially interested in hearing from you about are (1) videos you found useful, and (2) all useful resources in languages other than English.
