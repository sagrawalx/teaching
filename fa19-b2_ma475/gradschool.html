<h1 id="grad-school">Grad School</h1>
<p>If you’re planning on going to graduate school in mathematics or
something closely related, it’s probably worth pointing out that Riemann
integration is a topic that is typically covered in undergraduate real
analysis courses in the US. At CC, it’s sometimes discussed in MA475,
but we won’t be discussing it this block to make room for manifolds and
tangent spaces (these are topics I wish I had had exposure to as an
undergrad, whereas Riemann integration is not so hard to self-study in
my opinion).</p>
<p>Here are a few references you may look at to learn about Riemann
integration; I encourage you to go through one of them at some point
before starting graduate school.</p>
<ul>
<li>Protter and Morrey. <em>A First Course in Real Analysis</em>. 2nd
Edition. Chapter 5.</li>
<li>Rudin. <em>Principles of Mathematical Analysis</em>. 3rd Edition.
Chapter 6.</li>
<li>Trench. <em>Introduction to Real Analysis</em>. <a
href="https://digitalcommons.trinity.edu/mono/7/">Freely available
online</a>. Chapter 3.</li>
