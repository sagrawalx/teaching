# Resources

Here are some resources that you might use to understand things better. If you run into other resources that you find helpful, please share them with me so that I can share them with the class! I'd especially be interested in hearing about reliable freely available resources, and non-English language resources.

You might consider using the following to supplement your understanding of single variable and multivariable derivatives.

* Protter and Morrey. *A First Course in Real Analysis*. 2nd Edition.
    * You probably used this book for real analysis 1. Chapter 4 is single variable derivatives. Chapter 7 is multivariable derivatives (except that the inverse function theorem is in Chapter 14).
* Callahan. *Advanced Calculus: A Geometric View*.
    * This is a nice book with lots of pictures. I highly recommend checking it out. Chapters 1 through 5 cover single variable and multivariable derivatives. If I had to pick one more topic from this book to include in our course, it would be Chapter 7, "Critical Points."
* Munkres. *Analysis on Manifolds*.
    * Chapter 2 covers multivariable differentiation.
* Rudin. *Principles of Mathematical Analysis*. 3rd Edition.
    * This is the classical real analysis textbook. It's very challenging to read, but well worth the effort. Chapter 5 is single variable derivatives, and chapter 9 is multivariable derivatives.
* Spivak. *Calculus on Manifolds*.
    * Chapter 2 covers multivariable differentiation.
* Trench. *Introduction to Real Analysis*.
    * [Freely available online](https://digitalcommons.trinity.edu/mono/7/). Chapter 2 talks about single variable derivatives, and chapters 5-6 talk about multivariable derivatives.  

And you might consider using the following to supplement your readings on manifolds and tangent spaces.

* Gadea, Muñoz Masqué, and Mykytyuk. *Analysis and Algebra on Differentiable Manifolds*. 2nd Edition.
    * This is a nice book with lots of problems. Chapter 1 is the one that's most relevant to our course.
* Munkres. *Analysis on Manifolds*.
    * This was also listed above. Chapters 4 and 5 cover manifolds, though only manifolds that live inside $\mathbb{R}^n$. Chapter 6 talks about tangent spaces, but its interspersed with things about multilinear algebra that we won't be discussing.
* Spivak. *A Comprehensive Introduction to Differential Geometry.* Volume 1, 3rd Edition.
    * Chapters 1, 3, and 5 overlap significantly with the latter part of our class. If I had to pick one more topic out of this book to include in our course, it would be Chapter 5, "Vector fields and differential equations."
* Tu. *An Introduction to Manifolds.* 2nd Edition.
    * Sections 1–2, 5–9, and 11–13 are the parts that overlap with our course, but this book contains much, much more information than we'll be discussing. Section 14 overlaps with chapter 5 of Spivak's book cited above.

You may also find Serre's talk "[How to Write Mathematics Badly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJZpdXWm4Gg)" useful for improving your proof writing.
