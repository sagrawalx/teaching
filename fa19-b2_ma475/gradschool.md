# Grad School

If you're planning on going to graduate school in mathematics or something closely related, it's probably worth pointing out that Riemann integration is a topic that is typically covered in undergraduate real analysis courses in the US. At CC, it's sometimes discussed in MA475, but we won't be discussing it this block to make room for manifolds and tangent spaces (these are topics I wish I had had exposure to as an undergrad, whereas Riemann integration is not so hard to self-study in my opinion).

Here are a few references you may look at to learn about Riemann integration; I encourage you to go through one of them at some point before starting graduate school.

* Protter and Morrey. *A First Course in Real Analysis*. 2nd Edition. Chapter 5.
* Rudin. *Principles of Mathematical Analysis*. 3rd Edition. Chapter 6.
* Trench. *Introduction to Real Analysis*. [Freely available online](https://digitalcommons.trinity.edu/mono/7/). Chapter 3.
