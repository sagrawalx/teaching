<h1 id="quiz-1-exceptional-make-up-policy">Quiz 1, Exceptional Make-up Policy</h1>
<p>If you write up complete and correct solutions to any problems that you got wrong out of the following, I will give you half of the points that you missed for that problem.</p>
<ul>
<li>Problem 1</li>
<li>Problem 2</li>
<li>Problem 3</li>
</ul>
<p>Making up problems 2 and 3 is mostly about formalizing proofs. If you missed points on either or both of these, you had good intuition but struggled with formalization. Write up correct formal proofs to get back half the points you missed on these.</p>
<p>For problem 1, you’ll still get full credit for up to two of the ones you left blank if you come talk to me about them during quiz revisions on Monday afternoon. So look through the ones you got wrong. For each one that you got wrong but now understand, write up (i) a few informal sentences explaining how your intuition went wrong, and (ii) a formal solution (which could mean a proof of an abstract statement, or it could mean writing down an explicit example <em>with justification</em>, ie, a proof that your example has the properties you claim it has). For each one you do this for, you’ll get half a point.</p>
<p>You’re strongly encouraged to talk to each other or to me if you need help, but the final thing you submit must be written up in your own words.</p>
