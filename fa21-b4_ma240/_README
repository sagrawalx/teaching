Thoughts:
* Can consolidate more of the Tufte readings (eg, chapters 4-6 in one day) since students seem to find the minimalism a little redundant. 
* Spend more time on bootstrapping and revise the lab. Students did not seem to understand the idea of bootstrapping almost at all. 
* Could also spend more time reading Cleveland's books. 
* Maybe insist that students make at least one geographical graphic on the final project. They seemed to avoid doing this, except when they had to during the epidemic lab. 
* Give more hints on the epidemic lab? They don't deal with word breaks, don't expand the map to fit the lab, etc.
