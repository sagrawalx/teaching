# Choice Readings

For theoretical readings marked "Choice," you may choose to read anything that's along the lines of our earlier theoretical readings. For example, you could choose a chapter that sounds interesting from [War12] or [Cle93] or [Mac]. Or you could look up a recent academic paper related to some aspect of data visualization you're interested in. 

Share a reference to what you read on Discord (especially if you're choosing something that's not listed on the "[References](references)" page). For class, be prepared to share some salient points from what you read.
