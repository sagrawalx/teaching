<h1 id="final-project">Final Project</h1>
<h2 id="objective">Objective</h2>
<p>The goal of this project is to give you chance to explore a topic of
your interest that has some connection to differential equations, and to
share what you learn with your peers. It can be something purely
mathematical, or it can involve an application of differential equations
to an area of your choice.</p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>You’ll form groups of 2-4 and collectively choose a topic you want to
work on. Your group and topic will need to be approved by me: one person
in each proposed group should send me an email letting me know who
you’ll be working with and what you’ll be working on, by 11:59pm on the
third Tuesday.</p>
<p>For the last day of class, you’ll prepare a handout and a digital
presentation about your topic.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The handout should be one typewritten page (front and back). It
should give an introduction to the topic, and incorporate a detailed and
substantial proof and/or example. It need not be entirely original (ie,
you don’t need to prove a brand new theorem about ODEs), but it should
be fully explained <em>in your own words</em>. If you can incorporate
the results of some computer calculations, that would be awesome! The
handout should also include a list of works that you referenced, so that
someone who wants to learn more about your topic knows where to
start.</p>
<p>Bring some copies of your handout to the presentation (at least one
for me, and then a few more in case any of your peers would like to take
one).</p></li>
<li><p>The presentation should convey the main ideas of your topic and
some insightful examples. It should take about 10 minutes. We’ll use the
big data visualization wall in the library. Pictures and videos are
always nice, if at all possible (but remember that, if you don’t make a
picture or video yourself, you have to attribute it to whoever did). All
of the nitty gritty mathematical details do not need to appear during
the presentation (that’s what the handout is for), but make sure you do
incorporate some mathematical content at least at a high level. You
should be prepared to answer any questions me or your peers might have,
after your presentation is over.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind that the intended audience is one of your classmates:
someone who knows something about the kinds of ODEs we’ve discussed in
our class, but may not know anything specific about your topic.</p>
<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
<p>Your project score will be based on the following criteria.</p>
<ul>
<li>Content (out of 4 points). There should be correct and substantial
mathematical content involved (during the presentation, or on the
handout).</li>
<li>Clarity (out of 3 points). The topic should be clearly explained and
logically organized, in a way that is appropriate for the intended
audience.</li>
<li>Participation (out of 3 points). You’ll get full credit on
participation if it is clear that everyone in the group understands the
topic at the same level (in particular, everyone should have a
substantial role in the presentation).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="possible-topics">Possible Topics</h2>
<p>There are <em>so many</em> possibilities! I encourage you to be
creative. I only ask that it not be something that we’ve spent time
discussing as a class.</p>
<p>If you’re struggling to find things, here’s a short list of things
related to ODEs you might look into. I’ll keep adding to this list as I
think of more.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pendulums.</li>
<li>Lotka-Volterra model for predator-prey systems.</li>
<li>Compartmental models in epidemiology (besides SIR).</li>
<li>Runge-Kutta methods.</li>
<li>Bifurcation.</li>
<li>Laplace transform.</li>
<li>Lyapunov stability.</li>
<li>Ricatti equation.</li>
<li>Sturm-Liouville theory.</li>
<li>Chaos theory.</li>
<li>Singularities of linear homogeneous ODEs.</li>
<li>Vector fields on manifolds.</li>
<li>Proof of Picard’s existence and uniqueness theorem for first order
ODEs.</li>
<li>Proof of the fact that a homogeneous first order linear system with
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> equations and variable
coefficients has a solution space thats <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> dimensional (this involves a
multidimensional generalization of Picard’s existence and uniqueness
theorem for first order ODEs).</li>
</ul>
