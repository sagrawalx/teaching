# Final Project

## Objective

The goal of this project is to give you chance to explore a topic of your interest that has some connection to differential equations, and to share what you learn with your peers. It can be something purely mathematical, or it can involve an application of differential equations to an area of your choice.

## Description

You'll form groups of 2-4 and collectively choose a topic you want to work on. Your group and topic will need to be approved by me: one person in each proposed group should send me an email letting me know who you'll be working with and what you'll be working on, by 11:59pm on the third Tuesday.

For the last day of class, you'll prepare a handout and a digital presentation about your topic.

* The handout should be one typewritten page (front and back). It should give an introduction to the topic, and incorporate a detailed and substantial proof and/or example. It need not be entirely original (ie, you don't need to prove a brand new theorem about ODEs), but it should be fully explained *in your own words*. If you can incorporate the results of some computer calculations, that would be awesome! The handout should also include a list of works that you referenced, so that someone who wants to learn more about your topic knows where to start.

    Bring some copies of your handout to the presentation (at least one for me, and then a few more in case any of your peers would like to take one).

* The presentation should convey the main ideas of your topic and some insightful examples. It should take about 10 minutes. We'll use the big data visualization wall in the library. Pictures and videos are always nice, if at all possible (but remember that, if you don't make a picture or video yourself, you have to attribute it to whoever did). All of the nitty gritty mathematical details do not need to appear during the presentation (that's what the handout is for), but make sure you do incorporate some mathematical content at least at a high level. You should be prepared to answer any questions me or your peers might have, after your presentation is over.

Keep in mind that the intended audience is one of your classmates: someone who knows something about the kinds of ODEs we've discussed in our class, but may not know anything specific about your topic.

## Grading

Your project score will be based on the following criteria.

* Content (out of 4 points). There should be correct and substantial mathematical content involved (during the presentation, or on the handout).
* Clarity (out of 3 points). The topic should be clearly explained and logically organized, in a way that is appropriate for the intended audience.
* Participation (out of 3 points). You'll get full credit on participation if it is clear that everyone in the group understands the topic at the same level (in particular, everyone should have a substantial role in the presentation).

## Possible Topics

There are *so many* possibilities! I encourage you to be creative. I only ask that it not be something that we've spent time discussing as a class.

If you're struggling to find things, here's a short list of things related to ODEs you might look into. I'll keep adding to this list as I think of more.

* Pendulums.
* Lotka-Volterra model for predator-prey systems.
* Compartmental models in epidemiology (besides SIR).
* Runge-Kutta methods.
* Bifurcation.
* Laplace transform.
* Lyapunov stability.
* Ricatti equation.
* Sturm-Liouville theory.
* Chaos theory.
* Singularities of linear homogeneous ODEs.
* Vector fields on manifolds.
* Proof of Picard's existence and uniqueness theorem for first order ODEs.
* Proof of the fact that a homogeneous first order linear system with $n$ equations and variable coefficients has a solution space thats $n$ dimensional (this involves a multidimensional generalization of Picard's existence and uniqueness theorem for first order ODEs).
