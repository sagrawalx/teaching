<h1 id="autobio">Mathematical Autobiography</h1>
<p><strong>Overview.</strong> Write a mathematical autobiography (at
least 500 words). You’re welcome to take this in any direction you like,
but if you’re having trouble getting started, here are some questions
you might ponder.</p>
<ul>
<li>What early experiences do you remember having related to math?</li>
<li>What are some memorable (both good and bad) experiences you’ve had
with math?</li>
<li>Have you had any mathematical mentors who weren’t teachers in a
classroom setting (eg, parents, siblings, friends)?</li>
<li>How has your attitude towards math changed over the years?</li>
<li>What is something that feels good and/or exciting about learning
math? What do you find scary about it?</li>
<li>How does this particular math class, and math as a whole, fit into
your goals in life?</li>
<li>Have you found it to be socially acceptable to hate math? If so, why
do you think that is?</li>
<li>Have you noticed any differences in attitudes towards math between
here and wherever you grew up?</li>
<li>What do you think mathematics <em>is</em>? How would you define it
for an alien who is trying to understand what kinds of things human
beings think about and how mathematics fits into the landscape of human
inquiry?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>But why?!?</strong> You likely weren’t expecting an essay in
a math class. One reason that I’m having you do this is just that I
would like to get to know you and your history with mathematics. Another
reason is that there’s research in pedagogy suggesting that reflecting
on your experiences and molding a coherent narrative out of your
reflections can be very beneficial to the learning process.</p>
<p><strong>Help!</strong> Remember that you have access to the <a
href="https://www.coloradocollege.edu/offices/colketcenter/writing-center/">Writing
Center</a> for help with writing assignments.</p>
<p><strong>Grading.</strong> I do want to be able to understand what
you’ve written, but I won’t be marking you off for your spelling or
grammar or anything of the sort. All I’m looking for is evidence that
you’ve genuinely reflected on your relationship with math, and that
you’ve put some effort into organizing your thoughts on paper.</p>
<h1 id="bio">Mathematical Biography</h1>
<p><strong>Overview.</strong> Have a conversation with someone about
their experiences with mathematics. Then write about your
conversation.</p>
<p><strong>Conversation.</strong> Choose someone to talk to who you’re
comfortable having a potentially intimate conversation with: a friend, a
family member, a classmate, or whoever. If possible, try to choose
someone whose background is a little different from your own in some
way. You might choose someone whose interest level in math is different
from your own. Or you might choose someone whose identity differs from
your own in some dimension. Many different dimensions of identity might
impact someone’s relationship with math. There is data out there
suggesting that gender, sexual orientation, race, and ethnicity all
might play a role in shaping someone’s experiences with math. Other
dimensions of identity may be important as well.</p>
<p>It might be a good idea to plan out some questions you want to ask in
advance. You might ask them some of the same questions you asked
yourself when you were writing your mathematical autobiography. I also
encourage you to <em>listen respectfully</em> to what the person you
talk to has to say. Acknowledge the significance of their lived
experiences and the validity of their thoughts and opinions. Ask
questions as neutrally as you can. Do your best to keep your own
opinions out of the conversation, unless you really think that sharing
something might help them open up.</p>
<p><strong>Write.</strong> After you’ve had your conversation, write
roughly 500 words about it. Feel free also to use pseudonyms if that
makes things feel more comfortable. Describe what you learned about this
person and what your reaction to the conversation is. You might decide
to compare and contrast your experiences with theirs. Feel free to
structure this however makes most sense to you.</p>
<h1 id="final-reflection">Final Reflection</h1>
<p>Write up responses for each of the following (roughly 200-300 words
each).</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Creativity.</strong> Give an example of an idea from this
class that you found creative, or just “cool” in some way, and explain
what you find creative about it. Explain the idea briefly as you would
explain it to someone who hasn’t taken this class before. You could
describe a particular idea or technique that you learned that you found
to be cool, or you could describe an instance of creativity you
experienced in your own problem-solving (or someone else’s).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Meta-learning.</strong> This block, you were asked to
fill out weekly forms in which you reflected on your (mathematical)
learning habits. In these forms, you told me about what you were doing
to learn things, what you weren’t doing, what you were hoping to change
about your learning habits, etc. Describe one thing you learned about
your learning habits this block. Did you discover that you weren’t doing
something that maybe you should have been doing, or that you were doing
something that you shouldn’t have been doing? If you set a goal for
yourself to change one of your learning habits and followed through on
it, what did you find?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Persistence.</strong> Take one specific problem you
worked on this block that you struggled to understand and solve, and
explain how the struggle itself was valuable. In the context of this
question, describe the struggle and how you overcame it. Did you have a
“eureka!” moment, and if so, what seemed to bring it about? You might
also discuss whether struggling built aspects of character in you
(endurance, self-confidence, growth mindset, etc). How might these
virtues might benefit you in later ventures?</p></li>
