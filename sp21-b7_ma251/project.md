# Final Project

**Overview.** The goal for the final project is for you to learn about some piece of number theory that we didn't talk about in class. You can do this by yourself or with a partner. 

**Instructions.** 

1. Choose a topic. There are many possibilities here. Here are some that come to mind for me. 
    
    * Quadratic reciprocity (eg, chapter 9)
    * Cryptography (eg, chapter 10). Note: if you do this, make sure that you discuss at least one cryptographic protocol that's got some interesting number theory behind it. RSA, for instance, is very interesting from a number theory perspective. The Caesar cipher, on the other hand, is not very interesting from a number theory perspective (and also not very secure). 
    * Continued Fractions (eg, chapter 15)
    * Mersenne Primes (eg, chapter 11)
    * Algorithms for testing primality
    * Algorithms for factoring numbers
    * Algorithms for finding all prime numbers up to a given point
    * Algorithms for finding big prime numbers

2. Write up an exposition of the topic. Here are some thoughts about this part. 
    
    * It should be written in LaTeX.
    * Length is flexible; somewhere in the whereabouts of 2 pages might be reasonable. 
    * Make sure to give clear definitions of any new terms. 
    * If there's a theorem involved whose proof is too long or hard, you can omit the proof and just provide the statement. 
    * If you're talking about an algorithm, you should include a description of the algorithm (eg, in pseudocode). 
    * Write in a way that a fellow classmate would be able to understand what you've written! 
    * Make sure to cite your sources. 
    
3. Do something interesting with your topic. This is intentionally vague. Here are some thoughts: 

    * You could implement an algorithm. Write a bit about what your program does and what outputs you got. Include the code you used (this can be a separate file, if you like).  
    * If you're doing something that the book discusses, you could pick out a few  exercises from the relevant sections of the book and solve them. 
    * If you have an idea for something interesting you might want to do but aren't sure about it, feel free to run your idea by me! Alternatively, if you aren't sure what something interesting related to your topic  might be, feel free to chat with me and I can try to suggest something.
    
**Proposal.** During week 3, you'll be asked to submit a proposal. All you have to do for this is tell me who you'll be working with (if anyone) and what you're planning on doing. 

**Group submissions.** If you do work with someone, you should submit the proposal and the final project as a group through Gradescope by following [these instructions](https://help.gradescope.com/article/m5qz2xsnjy-student-add-group-members). 

**Grading.** Your project will be graded out of 10 points, roughly as follows. 

* (4 points) Mathematical content. For full credit, make sure that there's some substantial number theory in whatever you're working on. If you're unsure, you can run your idea by me. 
* (3 points) Exposition. For full credit, write up your exposition in a way that's easy to understand but also  mathematically precise.  Make sure to cite your references, too! 
* (3 points) "Something interesting." If you do exercises from the book, you'll get full credit if your solutions are correct and you pick out some exercises that are not too easy. If you do some programming, you'll get full credit if your code works like you think it should.
