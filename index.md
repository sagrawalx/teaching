This website (and the associated [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sagrawalx/teaching)) archives webpages for courses I've taught. It's intended to be both a record and a resource: if you teach math, you're welcome to steal anything from here that you like. Please also feel free to get in touch with me if you'd like to chat about something you find here.

# Archive

Here is a partial list of course webpages in this archive. For brevity, I've mostly only listed the most recent iteration of a given course at a given institution. This website does also archive other pages not linked below, and you can see what else is around in the associated [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sagrawalx/teaching).

# Zulip

In 2022, I started using [Zulip](https://zulip.com/) (along with [TallyBot](https://github.com/sagrawalx/tallybot)) to manage course-related communications, and you'll see links to [my organization](https://sunnysclasses.zulipchat.com/) on the webpages above. You're welcome to ask me more about this (eg, I'd be happy to share an invite link with you so that you can see how I set things up).
