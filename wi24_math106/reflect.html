<main>
<h1 id="reflection-assignments">Reflection Assignments</h1>
<p>Here are some assignments whose goal is to get you to reflect on your
mathematical learning, your attitude towards mathematical learning, and
so forth.</p>
<p><em>But why?!?</em> You might not have been expecting writing in a
math class. There are two reasons for doing this. First, we’d like to
learn something about your relationship with math. Second, there’s
research in pedagogy suggesting that reflecting on your learning
experiences can be very beneficial to learning.</p>
<p><em>Grading.</em> What’s important is just that you demonstrate (a)
that you did some genuine reflection, and (b) that you’ve tried to
organize your thoughts clearly into writing. You won’t be marked off for
spelling or grammar or anything of the sort.</p>
<h2 id="autobio">Mathematical Autobiography</h2>
<p><em>Overview.</em> Write a mathematical autobiography (around 500
words) and submit via Gradescope. You can take this in <em>many</em>
different directions, but here are some possibilities for
reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What kind of a mindset do you have towards math? In what ways is
it a “fixed mindset” and in what ways is it a “growth mindset”? What
experiences in your mathematical history might have contributed to this
mindset?</p>
<p>In case you haven’t heard the terms “fixed mindset” or “growth
mindset” before, here’s a quick summary. A person has <em>fixed
mindset</em> in an area if they believe their intelligence or abilities
in that area are fixed traits that cannot change. Characteristics of
having a fixed mindset include: avoiding challenges, giving up easily,
ignoring useful criticism, feeling threatened by others, etc. In
contrast, a <em>growth mindset</em> is the belief that your intelligence
and abilities in that area can grow with time, effort, and persistence.
Characteristics of a having a growth mindset include: embracing
challenges, persisting through obstacles, learning from feedback,
feeling inspired by others’ successes, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>If you feel that you tend towards having a fixed mindset in math,
what is another area in which you feel that you have a growth mindset?
How do the feelings you associate with engaging in that activity differ
from the feelings you associate with engaging with math? What
experiences do you think led you to have a growth mindset in that other
area? How do you think you might work on transferring that growth
mindset to math?</p></li>
<li><p>How does math as a whole, or this math class in particular, fit
into your life? How does it contribute towards your goals, towards
making you who you want to be? Even if you don’t intend to pursue math
as career, in what ways do you expect to grow as a person by studying
math broadly, or by studying the content of this course more
specifically?</p></li>
<li><p>Who in your life has contributed to your mathematical
development, and what role did they play? If relevant, think beyond just
teachers (parents, siblings, friends, classmates, etc).</p></li>
<li><p>What’s an example of an experience in your life where you really
enjoyed doing math? What made it so enjoyable? Were friends involved?
What aspects of those circumstances do you think are within your control
to recreate?</p></li>
<li><p>What role do you think diversity plays in mathematics? Can you
think of any personal mathematical experiences that were enriched by
diverse perspectives?</p></li>
<li><p>“I hate math.” You’ve almost certainly heard someone in your life
utter these words (or something very similar), and perhaps you’ve even
uttered them yourself at some point! Do you think there’s a difference
between how people react to this versus how they might react if someone
said something like, “I hate music”? If so, why do you think that is?
What might be the social ramifications of how common it is for people to
report “hating math”? Do you think it might be valuable to change this
culture, and if so, how might we go about that?</p></li>
<li><p>What do you think mathematics <em>is</em>? How would you define
it for an alien who is trying to understand what kinds of things human
beings think about and how mathematics fits into the landscape of human
inquiry? If this line of thought mires you in philosophical quandaries,
don’t worry; you’re in good company! In that case, maybe just propose
some <em>possible</em> definitions and then discuss what’s problematic
about each of them.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="weekly">Weekly Reflections</h2>
<p>At the end of weeks 2–9, take a few minutes to fill out the <a
href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSebLaXoyumV2dq63xX3f8XZ1z9Xd_ysO7lARVLnNeWRgbNPiQ/viewform">Weekly
Reflection Form</a>.</p>
<h2 id="final">Final Reflection</h2>
<p>TBA <!--
Write up responses to all of the following (around 250 words each). Submit via Gradescope.

1. *Cool Idea.* Give an example of an idea from this class that you found creative, beautiful, useful, or just "cool" in some way. Explain the idea briefly as you would explain it to someone who hasn't taken this class before, and then write about what you find creative/beautiful/useful/cool/etc about it. The idea could be a concept or technique you learned that you found particularly compelling, or an example of creative problem-solving that you encountered in your own work or in someone else's. You might also reflect on how mathematical creativity/beauty/coolness is similar to, or different from, other kinds of creativity/beauty/coolness/etc that human beings encounter. 

2. *Persistence.* Write about one specific problem you worked on this quarter that you struggled to understand and solve, and explain how the struggle itself was valuable. It can be any problem you encountered this quarter. Describe the problem and your struggle with it. If you overcame it, describe how. Did you have a "Eureka!" moment, and if so, what seemed to bring it about? Do you feel that this struggle built aspects of character that might benefit you in future ventures (endurance, self-confidence, growth mindset, etc)?

3. *Meta-learning.* Every week this quarter, you spent some time reflecting on your (mathematical) learning habits by filling out the Weekly Reflection Form. You used this to tell me about what you were doing to learn things, what you weren't doing, what you were hoping to change about your learning habits, etc. Describe one thing you learned about your learning habits this quarter. Did you discover that you weren't doing something that maybe you should have been doing, or that you were doing something that you shouldn't have been doing? If you set a goal for yourself to change one of your learning habits and followed through on it, what did you find? Was there a learning habit you acquired this quarter that you hope to carry with you into the future?
