# General Information

This page will be "under construction" throughout this quarter (especially any section that does not yet appear in the [Course Schedule](index#schedule)). Please feel free to point out any typos or mistakes! 

Each section below has a list of "Core Ideas" and a list of "Exercises."

The "Core Ideas" are a list of important definitions, theorems, etc, that you should know: 

* I've suggested possible readings for learning about these ideas. You can use the list of "Core Ideas" as a checklist as you do the reading. Feel free to supplement with other resources you find.
* Some of the content can be found in one of our [primary references](references). Some of it can be found in both, in which case you are welcome to read whichever you like better. 
* When a term doesn't have a completely standard definition (eg, if the definition varies between our two primary references), I've listed the definition I'd like to use for the purposes of our class and/or made notes about any possible discrepancies I could think of. Same with notation. 

The "Exercises" are for practice: 

* You are encouraged to do as many of the exercises as you can. 
* Give formal proofs whenever possible! For example, if an exercise asks you to "give a example" of something, make sure you include a proof that your example is in fact an example of that thing. 
* Sometimes, exercises define important concepts and develop further theory that will be used in the future. This means that, even if you don't do all of the exercises, you should at least read through all of them. 
* Sometimes, exercises ask you to state a definition of a term in italics. You may have to look this up. Use any resource: one of the books, the internet, whatever. 
* Sometimes, you might find the solution to an exercise as a proof of a proposition somewhere in one of the two primary references. This is meant to indicate to you that you should understand the core ideas well enough that you can come up with that proof on your own. 
* The first few exercises in each section are usually the easiest. After the first few exercises, there's no particular order to the exercises and you don't need to do them linearly. Sometimes, doing later problems might give you ideas or tools that are helpful for earlier problems. Sometimes, it may even help to come back to problems you didn't figure out before after you've seen later material.

Many of the exercises are stolen from [primary references](references), sometimes with a minimal amount of adaptation.

# Ring Theory Basics

## Core Ideas

* Definition of a *ring*.
    - Note: We will always assume that rings are commutative and have a multiplicative identity. 
* Definition of an *ideal*.
* Definition of the ideal $\langle S \rangle$ generated by a subset $S \subseteq R$. 
* Definition of a *finitely generated ideal* and of a *principal ideal*.
* Definition of a *quotient ring*, and the fact that it is in fact a ring.
* Definition of a *field*.
* Examples of fields: $\mathbb{Q}$, $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{C}$, and $\mathbb{F}_p$ for a prime $p$. 
    - Note: The field $\mathbb{F}_p$ might also be denoted $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$, $\mathbb{Z}_p$, or $\operatorname{GF}(p)$, depending on what you're reading. We will use the notation $\mathbb{F}_p$.

Possible reading: {{ clo15 | replace: "x", "Theorem 1.1.7 and Section 1.5" }}. You may remember the definition of irreducibility from Math 100B or 103B or the equivalent, but you can also find it in {{ clo15 | replace: "x", "Definition A.2.1" }} in a slightly more general context. 

## Exercises

1. In $\mathbb{Q}[x]$, compute the following. 
    a. $\gcd(x^4 + x^2 + 1, x^4 - x^2 - 2x - 1)$. 
    a. $\gcd(x^4 + x^2 + 1, x^3 - 1)$. 
1. Find a polynomial $f \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$ such that $\langle f \rangle = \langle x^3 + 2x^2 - x - 2, x^3 - x^2 - 4x + 4 \rangle$. 
1. Prove that $x^2+1$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{R}[x]$, and that it is *not* irreducible in $\mathbb{C}[x]$. 
1.  a. Prove that $x^2 + x + 1$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{F}_2[x]$. 
    a. Prove that $x^3 - x - 1$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{F}_3[x]$. 
    a. Read about the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$ for a prime $p$ and an integer $n \geq 2$. Then explain how the irreducible polynomials appearing in the previous two parts can be used to give explicit descriptions of $\mathbb{F}_4$ and $\mathbb{F}_{27}$. 
1.  a. Prove that there are infinitely many irreducible polynomials in $k[x]$. Hint: Does your proof work even if $k$ is finite? You could try mimicking Euclid's proof of the infinitude of primes. 
    a. Prove that any algebraically closed field has infinitely many elements. Hint: What are the irreducibles over an algebraically closed field? 
1. Suppose $f \in k[x]$ and let $f = a f_1^{m_1} \cdots f_r^{m_r}$ be the unique factorization of $f$ where $a \in k$ is the leading coefficient of $f$, each $f_i$ is monic and irreducible, and each $m_i$ is a positive integer. Define the *reduction* of $f$, denoted $f_{\mathrm{red}}$, by $$ f_{\mathrm{red}} = af_1 \cdots f_r. $$
    a. Prove that the radical of the ideal $\langle f \rangle \subseteq k[x]$ is $\langle f_{\mathrm{red}} \rangle$. 
    a. Suppose that $k$ has characteristic 0, ie, that $\mathbb{Q} \subseteq k$. Let $f'$ be the formal derivative of $f$. In other words, if $f = ax^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0$, then $$f' = nax^{n-1} + (n-1)a_{n-1}x^{n-2} + \cdots + 2a_2x + a_1.$$ Prove that $f_{\mathrm{red}} = f/\gcd(f, f')$. Note: You may use standard properties of derivatives (eg, the product rule). 
    a. Is the statement of the previous part of this exercise true for $k = \mathbb{F}_p$? If so, prove it. If not, provide a counterexample.
1. Observe that the field $\mathbb{C}$ is the smallest algebraically closed field containing $\mathbb{R}$. This is expressed by saying that $\mathbb{C}$ is an *algebraic closure* of $\mathbb{R}$. It is a fact that every field has an algebraic closure. Look up and read through a proof of this fact. (Maybe [these notes](https://www.cs.bsu.edu/~hfischer/math412/Closure.pdf) by Hanspeter Fischer?) You may also have to look up and read about *Zorn's lemma* as you do this. Then summarize the strategy of the proof in your own words. 

# Multivariable Polynomials

## Core Ideas

* Definition of a *monomial* and its *total degree*. 
* Definition of a *polynomial* in the variables $x_1, \dotsc, x_n$ over a field $k$ and its *total degree*. 
* The fact that the set $k[x_1, \dotsc, x_n]$ of all polynomials in the variables $x_1, \dotsc, x_n$ over a field $k$ forms a ring.

* Definition of a *homogeneous polynomial*. 

Possible reading: {{ ful08 | replace: "x", "Sections 1.1 and 1.4" }}. You can also look at {{ clo15 | replace: "x", "Section 1.1, Definitions 1.4.1--2, and Definition 7.1.6" }}. The Hilbert basis theorem also appears as {{ clo15 | replace: "x", "Theorem 2.5.4" }}, but that proof requires some concepts we have not yet discussed.

1. Let $R$ be a ring and let $I \subseteq R[x]$ be an ideal in a single variable polynomial ring over $R$. Let $J$ be the subset of $R$ consisting of leading coefficients of elements of $I$. Also, for an integer $m \geq 0$, let $J_m$ be the subset of $R$ consisting of leading coefficients of elements of $I$ whose degree is at most $m$. Observe that $$J_0 \subseteq J_1 \subseteq J_2 \subseteq \cdots \subseteq J \subseteq R.$$ This exercise is about working through some of the details in the proof of the Hilbert basis theorem as it occurs in {{ ful08 | replace: "x", "section 1.4" }}. 
    a. Verify that $J$ is an ideal of $R$. 
    a. Suppose $I$ is generated by $f_1, \dotsc, f_r \in R[x]$. Is it true that $J$ is generated by the leading coefficients of $f_1, \dotsc, f_r$? If so, prove it. If not, provide a counterexample. 
    a. Suppose that the leading coefficients of $f_1, \dotsc, f_r \in I$ generate $J$. Fix $g \in I$ such that $\deg(g) \geq \deg(f_i)$ for all $i$. Prove that there exist $q_1, \dotsc, q_r \in R[x]$ such that $\deg(g - \sum q_i f_i) < \deg(g)$. 
    a. Verify that each $J_m$ is an ideal of $R$. 
    a. Suppose $f_1, \dotsc, f_r \in I$ are polynomials of degree at most $m$ whose leading coefficients generate $J_m$. Suppose $g \in I$ and $\deg(g) = m$. Prove that there exist $q_1, \dotsc, q_r \in R[x]$ such that $\deg(g - \sum q_i f_i) < \deg(g)$. 
1. Consider the ideal $I = \langle x^2y^2z - 1, x^3yz^2 + 1 \rangle$ inside $k[x, y, z]$. 
    a. Regarding polynomials in $k[x, y, z]$ as polynomials in $z$ with coefficients in $k[x, y]$, what is the ideal $J$ of leading coefficients of elements of $I$? Find a finite generating set for $J$, and for each of the generators, find a polynomial in $I$ whose leading coefficient is that generator. 
    a. For each integer $m \geq 0$, let $J_m$ be the ideal in $k[x, y]$ of leading coefficients of elements of $I$ whose degree (when regarded as a polynomial in $z$ with coefficients in $k[x,y]$) at most $m$. Find a finite generating set for $J_m$, and for each of the generators, find a polynomial in $I$ of degree at most $m$ whose leading coefficient is that generator. Note: The answer depends on the integer $m \geq 0$, but it should "stabilize."
    a. Verify that all of the polynomials in $I$ that you've identified in the previous two parts do in fact generate $I$. 
1. Suppose $I = \langle f_1, \dotsc, f_r \rangle \subseteq k[x_1, \dotsc, x_n]$ and $f \in k[x_1, \dotsc, x_n]$. Prove that $f \in \sqrt{I}$ if and only if $\langle f_1, \dotsc, f_r, 1 - yf \rangle = k[x_1, \dotsc, x_r, y]$. Hint: Observe that $\langle f_1, \dotsc, f_r, 1 - yf \rangle = k[x_1, \dotsc, x_r, y]$ if and only if $1 \in \langle f_1, \dotsc, f_r, 1 - yf \rangle$. In an expression where $1$ is written in terms of these generators, what happens when you make the substitution $y = 1/f$? 

# Affine and Projective Spaces

## Core Ideas

* Definition of *affine $n$-space* over a field $k$.
    - Note: We follow the notation of {{ ful08 | replace: "x", "Section 1.2" }} in that we write $\mathbb{A}^n(k)$ instead of $k^n$, and when the field $k$ can be arbitrary or it can be inferred from context, we simply write $\mathbb{A}^n$. 
* Definition of the *projective plane* over $\mathbb{R}$.
* Definition of *projective $n$-space* $\mathbb{P}^n(k)$ over a field $k$.
    - Note: We simply write $\mathbb{P}^n$ when $k$ can be arbitrary or it can be inferred from context. The homogeneous coordinates of a point $P \in \mathbb{P}^n$ can be written $(a_0 : \cdots : a_n)$ or $[a_0 : \cdots : a_n]$. 
* For $i = 0, \dotsc, n$, the fact that the subset $U_i = \{ (a_0 : \cdots : a_n) \in \mathbb{P}^n \mid a_i \neq 0\}$ is in bijection with $\mathbb{A}^n$ and that its complement is in bijection with $\mathbb{P}^{n-1}$. 
* The fact that $\mathbb{P}^n = U_0 \cup \cdots \cup U_n$. 

Possible reading: For affine space, either {{ clo15 | replace: "x", "Definition 1.1.4" }} or {{ ful08 | replace: "x", "Section 1.2, first paragraph" }} is fine. For projective space, I recommend {{ clo15 | replace: "x", "Sections 8.1--2 up through Corollary 8.2.3" }}. You'd get all the necessary ideas from {{ ful08 | replace: "x", "Section 4.2" }}, but the exposition there is much more terse.

## Exercises

1. For each of the following pairs of lines in $\mathbb{A}^2(\mathbb{R})$, find homogeneous coordinates for their point of intersection in $\mathbb{P}^2(\mathbb{R})$. You can assume that $(x, y) \in \mathbb{A}^2(\mathbb{R})$ is identified with $(x : y : 1) \in \mathbb{P}^2(\mathbb{R})$. 
    a. $y = x$ and $y = -x + 1$.
    a. $y = 2x$ and $y = 2x + 1$.
1. Which points of $\mathbb{P}^2(\mathbb{R})$, if any, are *not* contained in $U_0 \cup U_1$?
1. Do {{ clo15 | replace: "x", "Exercise 8.1.2" }}.
1. Let $S^1 = \{ (x, y) \in \R^2 \mid x^2 + y^2 = 1\}$ be the unit circle. Give a geometric construction of a surjective function $S^1 \to \mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{R})$. What is the preimage of a point of $\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{R})$ under your function?
1. Suppose $k$ is a finite field with $q$ elements. How many points are in $\mathbb{P}^n(k)$? Find and prove a formula in terms of $q$ and $n$.
1. $\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{C})$ is sometimes called the *Riemann sphere*. The point of this exercise is to explain why. Let $$S^2 = \{ (x, y, z) \mid x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1\} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^3$$ be the unit sphere. The point $N = (0, 0, 1)$ is the *north pole* of $S^2$. 
    a. For any point $P = (x, y, z) \in S^2 \setminus \{N\}$, find a formula (in terms of $x, y, z$) for the point where the line connecting $P$ and $N$ intersects the plane $z = 0$. 
    a. Explain how the construction of the previous part gives a bijection $S^2 \setminus \{N\} \to \mathbb{A}^1(\mathbb{C})$. 
    a. Explain how to extend $S^2 \setminus \{N\} \to \mathbb{A}^1(\mathbb{C})$ to a bijection $S^2 \to \mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{C})$. 

# Affine Varieties

## Core Ideas

* Definition: For a subset $S \subseteq k[x_1, \dotsc, x_n]$, define $$V(S) = \{ (a_1, \dotsc, a_n) \mid f(a_1, \dotsc, a_n) = 0 \text{ for all } f \in S \} \subseteq \mathbb{A}^n.$$ An *algebraic subset* of $\mathbb{A}^n$ is one that is of the form $V(S)$ for some $S$. An *affine variety* is an algebraic subset of $\mathbb{A}^n$ for some $n$. 
    - Note: Our definition of "affine variety" matches {{ clo15 | replace: "x", "Definition 1.2.1" }}, which is more general than the definition in {{ ful08 | replace: "x", "Chapter 2" }}.
* Definition: For a subset $X \subseteq \mathbb{A}^n$, define 
$$ I(X) = \{ f \in k[x_1, \dotsc, x_n] \mid f(a_1, \dotsc, a_n) = 0 \text{ for all } (a_1, \dotsc, a_n) \in X \}. $$

# Polynomial Maps

## Core Ideas

* Definition: If $V$ is an algebraic subset of $\mathbb{A}^n$, the *coordinate ring* of $V$ is $k[V] = k[x_1, \dotsc, x_n]/I(V)$. 
    - Note: Other symbols that may be used for the coordinate ring include $\Gamma(V)$, $\Gamma(V, \mathscr{O})$, $\Gamma(V, \mathscr{O}_V)$, $\mathscr{O}(V)$, or $\mathscr{O}_V(V)$. All of these notations allude to sheaf theory, which is important in modern formulations of algebraic geometry but which you do not need to know about for this class. 
* Definition: If $V$ is an algebraic subset of $\mathbb{A}^n$, a *polynomial function* on $V$ is a function $\phi : V \to k$ such that there exists a polynomial $f \in k[x_1, \dotsc, x_n]$ for which $\phi(a_1, \dotsc, a_n) = f(a_1, \cdots, a_n)$ for all $(a_1, \dotsc, a_n) \in V$.

    - Note: If ambiguity can arise between the projective and affine versions of this construction, we write $\mathm{HF}^p_I$ and $mathrm{HF}^a_I$, respectively, to disambiguate. 
* The fact that any homogeneous ideal $I$ has the same Hilbert function as its ideal of leading terms $\langle \mathrm{LT}(I) \rangle$ for any monomial order. 
* The fact that the Hilbert function of a homogeneous ideal $I \subseteq k[x_1, \dotsc, x_n]$ is eventually a polynomial, called the *Hilbert polynomial* $\mathrm{HP}_I$. 
    - Note: If ambiguity can arise between the projective and affine versions of this construction, we write $\mathm{HP}^p_I$ and $mathrm{HP}^a_I$, respectively, to disambiguate.
* Definition of *dimension*, *index of regularity*, and *degree* of a homogeneous ideal. 
* The fact that, if $I \subseteq k[x_0, \dotsc, x_n]$ is a homogeneous ideal, then $$ \mathrm{HF}^p_I(s) = \mathrm{HF}^a_I(s) - \mathrm{HF}^a(s-1) $$ for all integers $s \geq 1$.
* The fact that if $I \subseteq k[x_1, \dotsc, x_n]$ is an ideal and $I^h \subseteq k[x_0, x_1, \dotsc, x_n]$$ is its homogenization with respect to $x_0$, then $\mathrm{HF}^p_{I^h}(s) = \mathrm{HF}^a_I(s)$.
