# Final Project

*Prompt.* Write a 5-ish page essay about a topic in, or related to, algebraic geometry. Submit via Gradescope. 

*Remarks.* If you'd like to, you may work in groups. $\TeX$ is encouraged but not required. 

*Possible Topics.* There are many! Feel free to be creative; the only requirement is that it not be something we have (or will have) talked about together in class. Here are some possibilities, some of which can be found in {{ clo15 }} or {{ ful08 }}.

* Improved Gröbner basis algorithms
* Elimination theorem
* Robot arms
* Noether normalization theorem
* Quadric hypersurfaces
* Max Noether's fundamental theorem
* Blowing up
* Riemann-Roch theorem
* Grassmannians and the Plücker embedding
* Elliptic curves and/or elliptic curve cryptography
* Algebraic geometry and error-correcting codes
* Affine toric varieties
* Algebraic geometry and phylogenetics
* Algebraic statistics
<!--
* Bézout's theorem
