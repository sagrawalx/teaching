# Quizzes

There will be 5 quizzes. The first 4 will take place in class on Mondays, and the last one will take place during finals week on Wednesday (March 20) at 9am.

* Content: Quizzes will be cumulative, though they will emphasize the newest material. There will be some true-false questions and some free response questions. Expect to have to write at least one formal proof. Questions will bear strong resemblances to the [exercises](content), and the best way to prepare is to do as many of the exercises as you can. 

* Format: You will have 50 minutes to work on the quiz.
