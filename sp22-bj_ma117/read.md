# Reading Assignments

*Instructions*. Each reading assignment has several parts. 

1. Reading some material from the textbook or from some other articles, as indicated below. 
2. Attempting the "Comprehension Check" (CC) exercises listed below. Submit your attempts through Gradescope. You'll get credit for sincere attempts; you don't need to get answers correct, and you can check your own answers against the back of the book. Note that the numbers below refer to the "Exercises" (as opposed to the "Guided Practice" problems). 
3. Participating on Discord in a way that shows that you sincerely engaged with the reading. Here is a non-exhaustive list of a few ways you might show this: 

    * Ask a question about something you didn't understand in the reading
    * Answer someone else's question about the reading
    * Describe something you found confusing at first but then managed to figure out
    * Share something "from real life" (news, social media, books, comics, jokes, etc) that's related to the reading (with an explanation of how it's related)

I have also listed some "Further Practice" (FP) exercises below. These will not be collected, but it is highly recommended that you try as many of them as you can. Similar problems could show up on quizzes and exams!
