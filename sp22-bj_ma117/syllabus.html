<p>Statistical thinking will one day be as necessary for efficient
citizenship as the ability to read or write. <span

</blockquote>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The time that H. G. Wells prophesied over a century ago has arrived.
MA117 is an introduction to statistics, ie, the practice of ethically
collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data.</p>
<p>Key concepts the course will cover include the structure of data,
numerical and graphical summaries of data, p-value hypothesis tests, and
confidence intervals. En route, the course will cover some concepts from
probability which form the mathematical backbone of statistical
analysis. The course will also serve as an introduction to programming
in R, a language that statisticians and data scientists use ubiquitously
today.</p>
<h2 id="course-structure-philosophy">Course Structure Philosophy</h2>
<p>In the long run, more important than learning any particular piece of
math is learning how to learn math independently (in pedagogical jargon,
that’s “how to be a <em>self-regulated learner</em> of math”). Improving
yourself in this regard is my foremost goal for you for this course.</p>
<p>Research shows that the following three things are key aspects of
this:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><em>Active Reading</em>. Reading math is very different from
other kinds of reading. You cannot read a math textbook the same way
you’d read a novel for pleasure if you want to get anything out of it.
You have to stop constantly as you’re reading math. Try to work out
examples yourself, instead of just reading through them. Doodle pictures
to make sure you have some kind of a picture in your head of what’s
going on. Formulate <em>precise</em> questions about things you don’t
understand.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Reciprocal Teaching</em>. Talking to your peers about math is
incredibly important. If you don’t understand a particular concept and
ask your peers, you’re much more likely to get an explanation that you
actually find helpful. If you think you do understand a particular
concept and help a peer who’s struggling, you’ll almost certainly find
that the process of explaining the concept to your peer will solidify
your own understanding of it.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Metacognition</em>. A key part of learning how to learn is
reflecting on your learning and taking the time to ask yourself
questions about your learning. What parts of your study habits are
working for you? What parts aren’t working? How actively are you
reading? Is there anything you could try changing?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>All three of these are built into the way the course is structured,
and it would benefit you to bear these things in mind as you go through
the course.</p>
<p>The first two things (active reading and reciprocal teaching) are at
the forefront of an evidence-based course structure known as <em>peer
instruction</em>, which was pioneered by the physicist Eric Mazur at
Harvard. It is predicated on the observation that “information transfer”
(listening to lectures or reading books) is easier than “information
assimilation” (solving problems and explaining concepts to others), so
it makes sense to move information transfer <em>out</em> of the
classroom and information assimilation <em>into</em> the classroom.
There’s a growing body of data that suggests this format is quite
effective: by a certain metric, it leads to a two-fold improvement in
conceptual understanding over more traditional methods!</p>
<p>To round off our three-pronged attack towards the goal of becoming
self-regulated learners of mathematics, you’ll be asked to complete a
variety of reflective assignments over the course of the block. I
encourage you to take these seriously and use them as opportunities to
understand and adapt your learning habits.</p>
<h2 id="course-materials">Course Materials</h2>
<h3 id="textbook">Textbook</h3>
<p>We’ll use an open-source textbook called <a
href="https://www.openintro.org/book/os/">OpenIntro Statistics</a>. You
can download it from the website (for whatever price you like, including
$0), or you can purchase a hard copy.</p>
<h3 id="r-rstudio">R + RStudio</h3>
<p>R is a programming language and RStudio is a convenient GUI for
programming in R. To get these going, you’ll need to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">Install R</a> and then <a
href="https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download">install
RStudio</a> (in that order!), or</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://rstudio.cloud">rstudio.cloud</a> in a
browser.</li>
</ul>
<p>My recommendation would be that you try to install R and RStudio on
your computer if at all possible. The software is open-source and free
to download, and is available for any operating system.</p>
<p>Rstudio.cloud is a decent fallback, but you might hit one or both of
the following hiccups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Free accounts on rstudio.cloud have a time limit (currently, 25
hours per month). That time likely won’t be enough for you to get
through the block, and when you run out of time, you’ll have to pay for
a Plus account (currently, $5 for up to 75 hours per month and then
$0.20 for each additional hour).</li>
<li>A few students in the past have had some minor technical issues with
rstudio.cloud that students using a desktop version didn’t have. Nothing
serious though.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have trouble installing R and RStudio on your computer, your
best bet is to get in touch with ITS for help. If you experience
technical delays related to installing the software, you might decide to
use a free rstudio.cloud account until you manage to get R and RStudio
running on your computer.</p>
<p>If you don’t have a computer (or you have a computer on which you
don’t have install privileges), let either me or Amy Pacheco Pray (<span
class="email" data-localpart="apacheco"
data-domain="coloradocollege.edu"></span>) know and we’ll try to figure
something out.</p>
<h3 id="discord">Discord</h3>
<p>There is a <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a> server for our
class. This will be a (virtual) space for you to ask and answer
questions about course content, to socialize, and whatever else seems
appropriate to you. I will also use Discord to make announcements
(shifted office hours, etc). You can install Discord on your computer or
phone, or you can use it in a web browser.</p>
<h2 id="course-mechanics">Course Mechanics</h2>
<h3 id="assignments">Assignments</h3>
<p>There will be a few different types of assignments in the course. All
assignments are due at 8am on the day indicated on the <a
href="index#calendar">calendar</a>. This will likely mean that you have
to complete the assignment the day before the deadline indicated on the
calendar. Deadlines will be strict, so please get things submitted on
time.</p>
<p><a href="read">Reading Assignments</a>: These daily assignments will
involve reading some sections from the textbook, attempting some
exercises, and participating the class Discord channel.</p>
<p><a href="reflect">Reflection Assignments</a>: There will be roughly
1–2 of these a week. They will ask you to reflect on various aspects of
your relationship with mathematics, your mathematical learning, etc.</p>
<p><a href="lab">Labs</a>: There will be roughly 2–3 of these a week.
These will require you to use R to analyze some data and answer some
questions. You should respond to each question as completely as you can.
If answering a question requires you have to write some code that isn’t
explicitly given to you in the lab directions, include your code. If you
generate a plot in the process of answering a question, include that
plot.</p>
<p><a href="project">Project</a>: There is just one of these for the
entire block. The final product for the project will be due at the end
of the block, but there will be some preliminary deadlines during the
block as well.</p>
<h3 id="in-class-structure">In-Class Structure</h3>
<p>I’ll begin class with a very brief discussion of the reading. This is
not intended to be a substitute for having done the reading! Instead, my
goal will just be to refresh your memory about the reading by working
through a couple of examples. We’ll spend most of class time doing one
or both of the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Solving problems together in the following format:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’ll put a multiple-choice problem on the board.</li>
<li>You’ll think about the problem by yourself for a couple of
minutes.</li>
<li>We’ll vote on an answer to the problem.</li>
<li>You’ll have a few minutes to talk to your classmates about the
problem.</li>
<li>We’ll vote again.</li>
<li>I’ll tell you how I’d answer the problem.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Doing worksheets. These won’t be collected, and will sometimes
involve using R.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="quizzes">Quizzes</h3>
<p>There will be two quizzes with deadlines on the first two Fridays.
Class will end by 10:45 on these Fridays so that you have time to take
your quizzes after class ends, but you can take the quizzes at another
time if you want or need. Quizzes will cover all material discussed in
readings up through the preceding Wednesday.</p>
<p>You may use one handwritten sheet of notes and a regular calculator
for quizzes. You are allocated 1 hour to work on quizzes. You will
access quizzes through Gradescope. Quizzes will be due through
Gradescope either by 1pm, or within 2.5 hours of the time when you
access the quiz on Gradescope, <em>whichever comes first</em>. These
deadlines will be strictly enforced, so please make sure you get quizzes
done and submitted on time.</p>
<p>I entrust to the <a href="#honor-code">Honor Code</a> that: (a) You
will only spend the allocated 1 hour working on the quiz. Gradescope’s
2.5 hour limit is set so that you have time to print and/or scan
materials, or in case you have arranged for extra time accommodations
with Accessibility Resources. (b) You will not use computers, friends,
textbook, internet, or anything else besides your handwritten sheet of
notes and a regular calculator. (c) You will not share information about
the quiz with classmates before they’ve taken it.</p>
<p>After quizzes are graded, you’ll have a chance to do revisions. You
can earn up to 2 points on your quiz by revising any problem(s) you’d
like to revise. Revisions will be oral: you should stop by my office
hours on the Monday following the quiz to talk to me about what you did
wrong and how you’d correct it. I may ask you some follow-up questions
during our conversation to make sure you understand your revision.</p>
<h3 id="final-exam">Final Exam</h3>
<p>There will be a final exam on the second-to-last day of class which
will cover all of the material in the course. The mechanics will be
identical to quiz mechanics (see above), except: (a) There will be no
class the day of the final exam. (b) You will have 2.5 hours to work on
the exam, with a 5.5 hour limit enforced by Gradescope. (c) There will
be no revisions for the final exam.</p>
<p>If your final exam score is higher than your lowest quiz score, it
will replace your lowest quiz score.</p>
<h2 id="assessment">Assessment</h2>
<p>Grades will be calculated as follows.</p>

<p>Here are further details about some of these components.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Daily Discord</em>. You get 1 point for each day that you
post to Discord for the <a href="read">reading assignments</a>, up to a
maximum of <span class="math inline">\(n-2\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the number of days a reading is
assigned. In other words, you don’t need to post every day to get full
credit, and there’s no extra credit for doing so.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Comprehension Checks</em>. You get 1 point for each problem
you attempt, up to a maximum of <span
class="math inline">\(n-10\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the total number of comprehension
check problems that are assigned. In other words, you don’t need to
submit comprehension checks every day to get full credit, and there’s no
extra credit for going above the requirements.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Participation</em>. You’ll get a full score for the
participation component of your grade if you show me somehow that you’re
putting in a good faith effort to engage with the class.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="accommodations">Accommodations</h2>
<p>If you anticipate or experience any disability-related barriers to
your learning in this course, please contact the office of <a
href="https://www.coloradocollege.edu/offices/accessibilityresources/">Accessibility
Resources</a> right away and have them send me an official letter
detailing what accommodations you require.</p>
<h2 id="covid-19">Covid-19</h2>
<p>The Covid-19 pandemic continues to challenge us as individuals and as
communities.</p>
<p>With the rapid spread of the omicron variant, there is a nontrivial
chance that you may find yourself in isolation. The class is set up so
that you’ll be able to submit everything remotely. You should also
prepare for the possibility of your isolation by making sure you have
contact information for a few students in class who can share their
class notes with you. If you’d like to attend class virtually during
your isolation, let me know an I’ll work with tech to set this up, but
it’s possible that it might take a couple of days for this to happen so
you should make sure you have a support network among your
classmates.</p>
<p>If you find yourself faced with a different Covid-related situation
that might affect your classwork, please let me know and I’ll do my best
to accommodate your situation. Also know that a variety of offices on
campus are available to help you through difficult situations. For
instance, you might get in touch with the <a
href="https://www.coloradocollege.edu/offices/counseling/">Counseling
Center</a>, or with <a
href="https://www.coloradocollege.edu/offices/campussafety/">Campus
Safety</a>. You can find more information and resources on the <a
href="https://www.coloradocollege.edu/other/coronavirus/">Coronavirus
Updates &amp; Resources page</a>.</p>
<h2 id="honor-code">Honor Code</h2>
<p>Please make sure that you are familiar with the <a
href="https://www.coloradocollege.edu/other/honorcouncil/resources/student.html">Honor
Code</a> at CC and that you abide by it. Violations of the Honor Code
will have to be reported to the Honor Council, which is really no fun
for anyone.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>This appears to be a false attribution — or rather, it
is a paraphrase. In <em>Mankind in the Making</em> (1903), H. G. Wells
writes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The great body of physical science, a great deal of the essential
fact of financial science, and endless social and political problems are
only accessible and only thinkable to those who have had a sound
training in mathematical analysis, and the time may not be very remote
when it will be understood that for complete initiation as an efficient
citizen of one of the new great complex world-wide States that are now
developing, it is as necessary to be able to compute, to think in
averages and maxima and minima, as it is now to be able to read and
write.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was later paraphrased by Samuel S. Wilks in his presidential
address to the American Statistical Association in 1950 in the form
quoted at the top of this syllabus, and this paraphrase has spread under
Wells’s name since then.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"
