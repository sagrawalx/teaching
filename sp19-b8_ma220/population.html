<h1 id="population-project">Population Project</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>This project asks you to explore a linear algebra model that is
sometimes used in population ecology. The output of this project is a
report that answers the questions below. Email me your report as a PDF
by 11:59pm on 3rd Monday. You’re strongly encouraged to discuss with
each other, but you should write up your report individually in your own
words.</p>
<p>You will need you to understand some matrix operations, and to know
how to do them on a computer. Specifically, the two operations you’ll
need to understand are matrix-vector products (look at Three.IV.2.3 in
the textbook) and matrix-matrix products (look at Three.IV.2.3 in the
textbook). The calculations involved below would be very tedious to do
by hand, but thankfully, there are many libraries out there to help you
do these calculations.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have a favorite programming language, I encourage you to
figure out how to do linear algebra calculations in that programming
language. Basically any programming language should be able to do the
kinds of calculations that are discussed below.</li>
<li>If you don’t have a favorite programming language, my suggestion is
to familiarize yourself with <a
href="https://www.sagemath.org/">SageMath</a>, an open source
mathematical programming language with fairly simple syntax (it builds
on top of Python). I’ve included some SageMath code snippets below to
help you, and I encourage you to talk to your classmates who might have
done some programming before if you’re struggling to figure out what to
do.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>We’re in charge of managing the population of a certain species of
fish in a certain lake. This species of fish has a life span of 4
years.</p>
<p>Every year, we run a census to find the number of fish of each age,
and record this number using a vector in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^{4}\)</span>. For example, a population
vector <span class="math inline">\(v = (100,90,80,70)\)</span> means
that there are 100 newborn fish, 90 1-year-old fish, 80 2-year-old fish,
and 70 3-year-old fish.</p>
<p>After collecting many years of data, we find that if the population
vector one year is <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>, then the
population vector the following year is given by the matrix-vector
product <span class="math inline">\(Av\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is the following <span
class="math inline">\(4 \times 4\)</span> matrix.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 &amp; 1.5 &amp; 4.2 &amp; 0 \\
0.5 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0.6 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0.4 &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix}\]</span></p>
<p>Suppose that the lake was empty in the year 2000 and we introduced
100 newborn fish into the lake. Let <span
class="math inline">\(v_n\)</span> denote the population vector when
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> years have elapsed. In other
words, we have <span class="math inline">\(v_0 = (100, 0, 0, 0,
0)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(v_1 = Av_0\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(v_2 = Av_1 = A^2v_0\)</span>, and so forth. The
matrix <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is called the
<em>evolution matrix</em> of the system.</p>
<p>Here’s how you would put the evolution matrix <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and the population vector <span
class="math inline">\(v_0\)</span> into SageMath.</p>

<p>Then, to calculate <span class="math inline">\(v_1 = Av_0\)</span>

<h2 id="part-1-basics">Part 1: Basics</h2>
<p>To answer the following questions, you might find it useful to
compute a few of the terms <span class="math inline">\(v_1, v_2, v_3,
...\)</span> by hand, to get some intuition about what the evolution
matrix is actually doing to the population vectors.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>These number in the first row of <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> are called <em>birth rates</em>.
Explain what these numbers mean.</p></li>
<li><p>The nonzero entries below the first row are called <em>survival
rates</em>. Explain what these numbers mean.</p></li>
<li><p>Calculate <span class="math inline">\(v_{10}, v_{100}\)</span>,
<span class="math inline">\(v_{1000}\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(v_{10000}\)</span>. Can you qualitatively describe
what happens to the fish population over time (eg, does it stay stable,
does it blow up, …)?</p></li>
<li><p>Compare <span class="math inline">\(v_{100}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(v_{101}\)</span> by finding a real number <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(v_{101}\)</span> is <em>approximately</em> equal
to <span class="math inline">\(\lambda v_{100}\)</span>. Then do the
same to compare <span class="math inline">\(v_{1000}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(v_{1001}\)</span>. Then do the same to compare
<span class="math inline">\(v_{10000}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(v_{10001}\)</span>. What do you notice?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The number <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> that you
found above is called the <em>dominant eigenvalue</em> of the system.
We’ll discuss eigenvalues more at the end of the block.</p>
<h2 id="part-2-pollution">Part 2: Pollution</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Suppose that pollution in the lake causes all of the birth rates
to decline by 15% and survival rates to decline by 15%. Let <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> denote the new evolution matrix. How
does the evolution matrix change? Can you write <span
class="math inline">\(B = DA\)</span> for some matrix <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span>?</p></li>
<li><p>Calculate <span class="math inline">\(v_1, v_{10}, v_{100},
v_{1000}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v_{10000}\)</span>.
Qualitatively describe what happens to the fish population in the
long-term.</p></li>
<li><p>Finding the dominant eigenvalue of the system; in other words,
find a real number <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> such
that <span class="math inline">\(v_{10000}\)</span> is
<em>approximately</em> equal to <span
class="math inline">\(v_{10001}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose instead that pollution in the lake causes all of the
birth rates to decline by 16% instead, and survival coefficients still
decline by 15%. Qualitatively describe what happens to the fish
population in the long term now, and find the dominant eigenvalue of the
system.</p></li>
<li><p>Make a conjecture relating the dominant eigenvalue to the
qualitative long-term behavior of the fish population. You don’t need to
prove your conjecture; we’ll come back to this at the end of the
block.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="part-3-sustainable-harvesting">Part 3: Sustainable
Harvesting</h2>
<p>Let’s ignore pollution and return the original evolution matrix <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Suppose that a harvesting scheme is enacted wherein 50% of all
fish are harvested every year. Let <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> denote the new evolution matrix. How
does <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> compare to <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span>?</p></li>
<li><p>Like you did above, find the dominant eigenvalue of the system,
and describe the qualitative long-term behavior of the fish population.
Would this harvesting scheme be sustainable over the course of 100
years?</p></li>
<li><p>Experiment to find what approximately what percentage of fish we
can harvest while maintaining an approximately stable population for 100
years.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="part-4-maximizing-harvesting">Part 4: Maximizing Harvesting</h2>
<p>In the previous part, we discussed a very basic harvesting scheme:
harvest some fixed percentage of fish every year. Here’s a SageMath code
snippet that calculates the total number of fish harvested over the
course of 50 years, assuming that every year we harvest 50% of the total
population. Lines preceded by a # are comments; they don’t do anything,
they’re just there to explain to you what each step of the code is
doing.</p>

<p>The output of the above code is 102.290076279678, which tells me that
over the course of 50 years, the total output of the this harvesting
scheme is about 102 fish.</p>
<p>Your job is to come up with a harvesting scheme that maximizes the
number of fish harvested from the lake over the course of 50 years. You
might start with experimenting with just varying the percentage of fish
harvested yearly, but you don’t have to harvest a fixed percentage of
all the fish every year. For example, what if you harvest only fish of
certain ages? What if you harvest more fish of certain ages than of
other ages? What if you wait some number of years before starting to
harvest? The possibilities are endless! Be creative :)</p>
<p>You don’t need to prove mathematically that your harvesting scheme is
the best possible scheme out there, but you should clearly explain all
of the harvesting scheme you experimented with in words, and indicate
which one you found to be the best. For the best harvesting scheme you
found, you should also include clearly commented code (like above) that
you used to calculate the total number of fish harvested over the course
of 50 years.</p>
<p>This is kind of just a game; depending on what harvesting scheme you
choose, you may end up with unrealisitically<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
large numbers of fish, and that’s okay! To make it more game-like, maybe
there’ll be an edible prize for the best harvesting scheme in the class!
