[^behind]: These in class problems are all about dimension (rather than isomorphisms), so, topically speaking, belong with the in class problems from Week 1, Friday. Our in class discussions are a bit behind the reading schedule, but hopefully we'll catch up soon. We'll have some spare time on Thursday to play catch-up too.

[^1]: You might find this topic quite challenging, but it's also really important to get down. I've assigned a lot of exercises to help with this. If you can understand what's going on with matrix representations, you'll have a much easier time when we discuss change of basis and diagonalization next week!
