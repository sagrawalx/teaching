# Linear Algebra Resources

There are *many, many* resources out there about linear algebra. Here's a list of some that I know about. You'll find many more if you go searching. I encourage you to start with our textbook, and then supplement with at most one or two other resources to help solidify your understanding. If you try to look at everything, you'll just overwhelm yourself.

* Freely available textbooks:
    * Beezer. [A First Course in Linear Algebra](http://linear.ups.edu/).
    * Boyd and Vandenberghe. [Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra: Vectors, Matrices, and Least Squares](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/vmls/).
    * Treil. [Linear Algebra Done Wrong](https://www.math.brown.edu/~treil/papers/LADW/).
* Other free resources (with videos!):
    * Khan Academy. [Linear Algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra).
    * Strang. [MIT OpenCourseWare for 18.06, Fall 2011](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/).
    * Vogan. [MIT OpenCourseWare for 18.700, Fall 2013](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-700-linear-algebra-fall-2013/).
* Textbooks you could purchase:
    * Axler. *Linear Algebra Done Right*. 3rd edition. (I *highly* recommend this book, especially if you're planning to be a math major!)
    * Lay, Lay, and MacDonald. *Linear Algebra and its Applications*. 5th edition.

If you find something that you like a lot, let me know and I'll add it to this list for your fellow students!
