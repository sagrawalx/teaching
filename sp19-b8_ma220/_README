make Three.IV.3 (mechanics of matrix multiplication) more optional somehow...
probably, add footnote to reading assignment indicating this, and then move the
exercise to the problem set

population project
part 2 (pollution), question 1, birth rates should decline by 35%
36% for the latter part
part 3, give a hint about modifying the matrix
part 4, make this better (income+early retirement? two populations?)

final exam
question 2, #(9), fix this!

make quizzes first thing in the day?
make quizzes Friday afternoon?

point out the videos on the resources page

full 3 hours

easier Sage project than population project...?
