<h1 id="population-project-grading">Population Project Grading</h1>
<p>Overall, I was very impressed with everyone’s reports for the <a href="population">population project</a>! It seemed to me like you all thought deeply about this population model and developed good intuition about it.</p>
<p>The population project was graded out of 15 points. Here were the common mistakes I noticed, together with how many points were deducted for each of these mistakes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Part 2, Question 1. Some of you proposed that <span class="math display">\[D = \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 0.85 &amp; 0.85 &amp; 0 \\ 0.85 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0.85 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0.85 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}.\]</span> This is not correct; remember that matrix multiplication does not happen entrywise. If you made this mistake, 1 point was deducted.</li>
<li>Part 2, Question 5. If you made no conjecture at all, 1 point was deducted. If you conjectured that the population grows more rapidly the bigger that <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> is, but did not make a conjecture about what happens when <span class="math inline">\(\lambda &lt; 1\)</span>, 0.5 points were deducted. If you made a conjecture about the dominant eigenvalue, but your conjecture is unrelated to the qualitative long-term behavior of the population, 0.5 were deducted.</li>
<li>Part 3, Question 1. Almost the entire class decided that the first row of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> should be the same as the first row of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, and all entries of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> below the first row should be 50% of the corresponding entries of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. This is incorrect, and is a fairly subtle issue. The correct answer is that all entries of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> are 50% of the corresponding entries of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, <em>even the entries in the first row</em>. If you made this mistake, 0.5 points were deducted.</li>
<li>Part 4. If you describe a reasonable harvesting strategy but the code you shared with me is not computing the correct total number of fish harvested based on your verbal description of the harvesting strategy, 1 point was deducted. If you described a reasonable harvesting strategy, but your total harvested seems incorrect and you did not share any code with me for your optimal harvesting strategy, 2 points were deducted. If you only shared code and no verbal description, 4 points were deducted.</li>
</ul>
<p>If I noticed any other problems in your report individually, I’ll make a note of it to you personally.</p>
