<h1 id="introduction-to-bootstrapping">Introduction to
Bootstrapping</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Let us say loosely that an <em>aggregation function</em> is a
function which takes as input some data and outputs a single number. For
example, the function which takes as input data from a single numerical
variable and outputs the mean (or median, or 25th percentile, or 53rd
percentile, or standard deviation) is an aggregation function. The
function which takes as input data from a single binary variable and
outputs the percentage of <code>TRUE</code> values is also an
aggregation function. We can also have aggregation functions which take
as input data from multiple variables. For example, you might be
interested in the function which takes as input data from two numerical
variables, and outputs the slope of the least squares regression line.
As is probably clear, almost anything can be considered an aggregation
function.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Suppose I fix an aggregation function. If I were able to evaluate the
aggregation function on data from the entire population, the output
would be called a <em>population parameter</em>. Of course, in many
situations of interest, we do not have population data. Instead, we
merely have data from a random sample. The output of the aggregation
function on this data from a random sample is called a <em>sample
statistic</em> (sometimes also called a <em>point estimate</em>).</p>
<p>When we calculate a sample statistic, it’s often a good idea to try
to understand how “uncertain” we should be about its value. How far
might the value of the population parameter be? How different might the
sample statistic have been if we had chosen a different random
sample?</p>
<p>These questions can be formalized precisely using mathematics. There
is probability space which lists off all of the possible random samples
of a given size. The aggregation function can then be regarded as a
random variable on this probability space. The “uncertainty of the
sample statistic” is then formalized by asking: what is the distribution
of this random variable? This distribution is called the <em>sampling
distribution</em> of the statistic.</p>
<p>We can sometimes derive what the sampling distribution looks like on
the nose, but only in somewhat special situations.
<em>Bootstrapping</em> is a widely applicable strategy for approximating
the sampling distribution of a test statistic, no matter what
aggregation function we might be interested in.</p>
<p>The idea is that we repeatedly <em>resample with replacement</em>
from our random sample, evaluate the aggregation function from each of
those resamples, and build a distribution of the outputs. The result of
this process is called the <em>bootstrap distribution</em>.</p>
<p>Difficult mathematics guarantees that, for almost any aggregation
function and almost any population distribution, the bootstrap
distribution you get from your sample will be a good stand-in for the
sampling distribution (at least as long as your sample was “large
enough,” where the precise definition of “large enough” depends on what
aggregation function you’re dealing with). Thankfully, while it may be
difficult to prove this, it’s not at all difficult to apply this idea in
practice!</p>
<h2 id="extended-example">Extended Example</h2>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Suppose I’m interested in the 75th percentile (ie, third quartile) of
departure delays of flights out of NYC, and that I collect a random
sample of data from 2000 flights to figure out what the 75th percentile
might be.</p>
<p>Let me simulate this by taking a random sample of 2000 flights from
the <code>nycflights13::flights</code> data set.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">library</span>(tidyverse)</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">library</span>(nycflights13)</span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>sample_size <span class="ot">=</span> <span class="dv">2000</span></span>
<span id="cb1-5"><a href="#cb1-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>sample <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> flights <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span> <span class="fu">slice_sample</span>(<span class="at">n =</span> sample_size)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>I’m now going to forget about the <code>flights</code> tibble and
pretend like <code>sample</code> is the only data I have access to
(except for a brief interlude below). The R function
<code>quantile</code> is useful for calculating percentiles. The
following outputs the 75th percentile of the <code>dep_delay</code>
column of <code>samples</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">quantile</span>(sample<span class="sc">$</span>dep_delay, <span class="at">prob =</span> <span class="fl">0.75</span>, <span class="at">names =</span> <span class="cn">FALSE</span>, <span class="at">na.rm =</span> <span class="cn">TRUE</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>For me, this outputs 10, but you might get something else since your
random sample will be different. This means that 75% of flights in my
sample have a departure delay of less than 10 minutes from their
scheduled departure time.</p>
<p>Since the call to <code>quantile(...)</code> above involves a lot of
typing, let’s save ourselves some typing by defining a new function,
called <code>q3</code>, which does the same thing:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>q3 <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="cf">function</span>(x) {</span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="fu">quantile</span>(x, <span class="at">prob =</span> <span class="fl">0.75</span>, <span class="at">na.rm =</span> <span class="cn">TRUE</span>, <span class="at">names =</span> <span class="cn">FALSE</span>)</span>
<span id="cb3-3"><a href="#cb3-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Running <code>q3(sample$dep_delay)</code> still outputs 10 (for me),
as it should! It’s still the same sample, after all. Check that you
still get the same output.</p>
<p>The function <code>q3</code> is the relevant aggregation function in
this extended example. When you bootstrap in other settings, you’ll have
to swap out <code>q3</code> for whatever other aggregation function you
might be interested in.</p>
<p>Now I might want to understand how uncertain I ought to be about this
10 number that I calculated.</p>
<h2 id="interlude-lets-stop-pretending">Interlude: Let’s Stop
Pretending</h2>
<p>For a moment, let’s stop pretending that we don’t have access to the
full <code>flights</code> data set. I can use this full data set to
calculate the true 75th percentile (ie, the population parameter):</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">q3</span>(flights<span class="sc">$</span>dep_delay)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>It turns out to be 11, so the statistic I calculated from my sample
wasn’t too far off.</p>
<p>I can also calculate the true sampling distribution by repeatedly
sampling from the full data set. Here’s how to do this. (Don’t worry too
much about how this piece of code works right now. We’ll discuss the
important parts below, and then if you like, you can come back to this
code and figure out what it’s doing.)</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">library</span>(modelr)</span>

<span id="cb5-10"><a href="#cb5-10" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  </span>
<span id="cb5-11"><a href="#cb5-11" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>samples <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span> </span>

<p>The output shows us roughly what the true sampling distribution looks
like.</p>
<p><img src="q3-sampling-dist.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding-top: 1em;"/></p>
<p>This gives us some indication for how uncertain to be about our
statistic. It shows us, for example, that, though 11 is the most common
75th percentile that one might obtain from a random sample of size 2000,
a sample whose 75th percentile is 10 (like the sample that I got) is not
so uncommon.</p>
<!--
If you'd like to extract a number that measures this uncertainty, you can calculate the  *standard error*, ie, the standard deviation of the sampling distribution: 

```R
sd(samples$q3)
```

I get about 1.21 when I do this. A loose way of  interpretting this is as specifying a kind of range around the population parameter: *most* samples of size 2000 taken from `flights` will have a 75th percentile that's within 1.21 minutes of the true parameter value (ie, of 11 minutes). Since my sample's 75th percentile was in fact within 1.21 minutes of the parameter value, my sample wasn't too unusual. 

Standard error isn't the only number you can extract from the sampling distribution, but it is a relatively straightforward one. There are many others of varying degrees of complexity. -->
<p>When the sampling distribution is roughly symmetric and centered
about the true population parameter (as it is above), the aggregation
function is said to be “unbiased.” There are various ways of making this
a precise mathematical definition which aren’t worth dwelling on here,
but most aggregation functions that one uses in practice are unbiased
according to at least one of these definitions of unbiased. It’s
possible to deal with biased aggregation functions, but things get a
little more complicated.</p>
<p>Let’s now go back to pretending that we don’t have access to the
<code>flights</code> data set. In real life, we won’t often have access
to population data (and even if we do, constructing a sampling
distribution from the population data would be a somewhat academic
exercise). There’s now know way of knowing that the parameter value is
actually 11, or of knowing what the sampling distribution looks like, or
of knowing the standard error.</p>
<p>But we <em>can</em> calculate the bootstrap distribution, which is an
approximation for the sampling distribution. To do this, we’ll
repeatedly take resamples of size 2000 with replacement from
<code>sample</code>, and then compute the 75th percentile of each of
those resamples. Note that it’s important that the resamples are chosen
<em>with replacement</em>. If we were to choose a sample of size 2000
from <code>sample</code> <em>without</em> replacement, the result will
always just be all of <code>sample</code>, since <code>sample</code> has
2000 elements!</p>
<h2 id="resamples">Resamples</h2>
<p>The <code>modelr</code> package provides some useful tools for
resampling. It’s a <code>tidyverse</code> package, but isn’t loaded in
by default with the <code>library(tidyverse)</code> command, so you
should load it in now. (You might already have done this if you copied
the previous chunk of code into the console, but there’s no harm in
doing it again.)</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">library</span>(modelr)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>To understand resamples, let’s take a single resample with
replacement from <code>sample</code> of the same size as
<code>sample</code>. The function <code>resample_bootstrap</code> does
exactly this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>resample <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">resample_bootstrap</span>(sample)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This generates an object of type “resample,” which is sort of like a
tibble — except it’s not. To save space in memory, it’s actually just a
list of pointers to rows in <code>sample</code>. To turn it into an
actual tibble, you have to use the function <code>as_tibble</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">as_tibble</span>(resample)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now if I want to compute the 75th percentile of departure delays from
this resample, I’d can do this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">q3</span>(<span class="fu">as_tibble</span>(resample)<span class="sc">$</span>dep_delay)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Or, if you’re really into pipes, you could equivalently do this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb10"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb10-1"><a href="#cb10-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>resample <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span></span>
<span id="cb10-2"><a href="#cb10-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="fu">as_tibble</span>() <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span></span>
<span id="cb10-3"><a href="#cb10-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="fu">pull</span>(dep_delay) <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span></span>
<span id="cb10-4"><a href="#cb10-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="fu">q3</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="bootstrapping">Bootstrapping</h2>
<p>To bootstrap, we’re going to take 5000 resamples. Note that the
number 5000 is arbitrary; feel free to choose any big number when you’re
bootstrapping. The bigger the better, but of course computations will
get slower with bigger numbers.</p>
<p>The <code>bootstrap</code> function from <code>modelr</code>
repeatedly performs <code>resample_bootstrap</code>, as many times as
you specify, and stores the results of each resample in a row in a
tibble.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb11"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb11-1"><a href="#cb11-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">library</span>(modelr)</span>
<span id="cb11-2"><a href="#cb11-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>repetitions <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="dv">5000</span></span>
<span id="cb11-3"><a href="#cb11-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>resamples <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">bootstrap</span>(sample, repetitions)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The result of this is a tibble named <code>resamples</code> with 5000
rows, each corresponding to one resample. There are two columns: one
named <code>strap</code> which contains the actual <code>resample</code>
object, and one named <code>.id</code> which assigns a number to each
resample.</p>
<p>We’re now going to add a column named <code>q3</code> to
<code>resamples</code>. This column will record the 75th percentiles of
all of the resamples.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb12"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb12-1"><a href="#cb12-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>resamples <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> resamples <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span> </span>
<span id="cb12-2"><a href="#cb12-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="fu">mutate</span>(<span class="at">q3 =</span> <span class="fu">map_dbl</span>(strap, <span class="sc">~</span> <span class="fu">q3</span>(<span class="fu">as_tibble</span>(.)<span class="sc">$</span>dep_delay)))</span></code></pre></div>
<p>What’s going on here? The function <code>map_dbl</code> takes as
input a list and outputs a list of <code>dbl</code>s (ie, decimal
numbers). The list it takes as input is specified by the first argument
to <code>map_dbl</code> — in this case, the <code>strap</code> column of
<code>resamples</code>, which is a list of objects of type “resample.”
It then applies the function that follows the <code>~</code> to each
object in the input list, substituting that object in place of the
<code>.</code> that shows up in the expression. This gives us a list of
doubles (each double being the 75th percentile of departure delays of
each resample), and we assign that list of doubles to be a column named
<code>q3</code> in the <code>resamples</code> tibble.</p>
<p>Note <code>q3</code> is now both a function as well as a column in
<code>resamples</code>. Make sure you know which one is being talked
about whenever you type <code>q3</code> from here on out.</p>
<p>You can now make a histogram of these 75th percentiles to see the
bootstrap distribution.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb13"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb13-1"><a href="#cb13-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>resamples <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span></span>
<span id="cb13-2"><a href="#cb13-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="fu">ggplot</span>(<span class="fu">aes</span>(q3)) <span class="sc">+</span> </span>
<span id="cb13-3"><a href="#cb13-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="fu">geom_histogram</span>(<span class="at">binwidth =</span> <span class="dv">1</span>) <span class="sc">+</span> </span>
<span id="cb13-4"><a href="#cb13-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="fu">scale_x_continuous</span>(<span class="at">breaks =</span> <span class="dv">5</span><span class="sc">:</span><span class="dv">16</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You should now see a distribution that isn’t <em>too</em> different
from the sampling distribution that we made during the interlude, but
instead of being centered around 11, it’ll probably be centered around
whatever you got for <code>q3(sample$dep_delay)</code>. Here’s what I
see:</p>
<p><img src="q3-bootstrap-dist.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding-top: 1em;"/></p>
<h2 id="standard-error">Standard Error</h2>
<p>Once you have a bootstrap distribution, you can extract quantitative
measures of uncertainty from it. The easiest of these is the standard
error.</p>
<p>By definition, <em>standard error</em> is the standard deviation of
the sampling distribution. We don’t know what the sampling distribution
is (or rather, we’re pretending we don’t…), so a good stand-in is the
standard deviation of the bootstrap distribution. We can calculate this
as follows:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb14"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb14-1"><a href="#cb14-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">sd</span>(resamples<span class="sc">$</span>q3)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>I get 1.52, but you might get something a little different since your
<code>sample</code> and <code>resamples</code> will be different from
mine.</p>
<p>A loose way to interpret this 1.52 value is as specifying some kind
of range around the statistic. It’s saying roughly that the it would not
be too surprising if the true parameter value was within 1.52 units of
the sample statistic that I obtained from my sample.</p>
<p>We saw during the interlude that the parameter value was 11 – which
is in fact within 1.52 minutes of my sample statistic. Is the parameter
value within the range specified by the standard error of your sample
statistic? (It might not be, and that’s okay.)</p>
<h2 id="required-exercise">Required Exercise</h2>
<p>Using your <code>sample</code> and your bootstrap
<code>resamples</code>, generate a plot like this:</p>
<p><img src="q3-by-carrier.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding-top: 1em;"/></p>
<p>The points in this plot mark off the 75th percentile of the departure
delays of each carrier, and the lines extend from the 75th percentile
minus the standard error to the 75th percentile plus the standard error.
The carriers on the y-axis are sorted by the 75th percentile of their
departure delays.</p>
<p>Note that, depending on the <code>sample</code> you’re working with,
your plot might look radically different from the one above: the
ordering of carriers could be very different, some carriers might have
huge standard errors, some carriers might just be points without
intervals, etc. Remember at the end of the introduction where we said
“if the same size is ‘large enough’”? The issue here is that a sample of
size 2000 is not really big enough for this particular calculation to be
stable. It’s big enough for the standard error calculation for the 75th
percentile of <em>all</em> flights to be relatively stable, but after
grouping into categories based on carrier, some of the groups have too
small a sample — especially the groups corresponding to carriers that
have very few flights represented in the <code>flights</code> data
set.</p>
<p>So, after you get your code working with your original
<code>sample</code> of size 2000, take a new larger <code>sample</code>
of size 20000 from <code>flights</code>. Filter out the carriers which
have very few observations. Build a bootstrap distribution using your
filtered sample, and then use this bootstrap to generate the same kind
of plot as the one above.</p>
<p>This exercise might be a little challenging. It may be helpful to
review the <code>dplyr</code> functions <code>group_by</code> and
<code>summarize</code>, and to browse the <code>dplyr</code> and
<code>tidyr</code> <a
href="https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/">cheatsheets</a>
for other helpful functions.</p>
<p>For the purposes of grading, we’ll pretend that this exercise belongs
to [WNP21, Section 5.1] (which has no associated exercises). In other
words, you should do this exercise as a part of assignment <a
href="../assignments#F">F</a>.</p>
<h2 id="confidence-intervals">Confidence Intervals</h2>
<p>Another quantitative measure of uncertainty that can be extracted
from a bootstrap distribution is a <em>confidence interval</em>. There
are several different types of bootstrapped confidence intervals. Here,
we just focus on one simple type.</p>
<p>The confidence interval of confidence level <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> goes from the <span
class="math inline">\(((1-\gamma)/2)\)</span>th percentile of the
bootstrap distribution up to the <span
class="math inline">\((1-(1-\gamma)/2)\)</span>th percentile. For
example, if <span class="math inline">\(\gamma = 0.9\)</span>, we have
<span class="math inline">\((1-\gamma)/2 = 0.05\)</span> and the 90%
confidence interval goes from the 5th to the 95th percentile of the
bootstrap distribution. Recall that the bootstrap distribution is stored
in <code>resamples$q3</code>, and we can use the <code>quantile</code>
function to calculate its percentiles. In fact, we can calculate both in
one go:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb15"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb15-1"><a href="#cb15-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">quantile</span>(resamples<span class="sc">$</span>q3, <span class="at">probs =</span> <span class="fu">c</span>(<span class="fl">0.05</span>,<span class="fl">0.95</span>), <span class="at">names =</span> <span class="cn">FALSE</span>) </span></code></pre></div>
<p>For me, this outputs a 5th percentile of 8 and a 95th percentile of
12. I interpret this confidence interval by saying that I am 90%
confident that the true 75th percentile of departure delays is between 8
and 12.</p>
<p>As I know from the interlude, the true value (ie, 11) is in fact in
this range. Does your 90% confidence interval contain the true value?
Even before you’ve done it, I know that there’s a 90% chance that it
will. (If it doesn’t, that’s okay! After all, there is a 10% chance that
it won’t.)</p>
<h2 id="optional-exercises">Optional Exercises</h2>
<p>Here are some more exercises that you might choose to do as a part of
assignment <a href="../assignments#F">F</a> to get to the 10 problem
total.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Calculate 80%, 95%, and 99% confidence intervals for the 75th
percentile of departure delays from your bootstrap
distribution.</p></li>
<li><p>Change the plot from the <a href="#required-exercise">required
exercise</a> so that the lines display 90% confidence intervals (instead
of the standard error). In other words, the line segments should stretch
from the lower endpoint of the 90% confidence interval to the upper
endpoint.</p></li>
<li><p>Here’s how you’d use <code>geom_density</code> to display the
bootstrap distribution:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb16"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb16-1"><a href="#cb16-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>resamples <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span></span>
<span id="cb16-2"><a href="#cb16-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="fu">ggplot</span>(<span class="fu">aes</span>(q3)) <span class="sc">+</span> </span>
<span id="cb16-3"><a href="#cb16-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="fu">geom_density</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You’ll probably notice something strange when you do this. Try
replacing <code>geom_density()</code> with
<code>geom_density(adjust = 1/2)</code> or
<code>geom_density(adjust = 2)</code> or
<code>geom_density(adjust = 4)</code>, and so forth, until you see
something that looks reasonable. Once you’ve found something that seems
reasonable, what are your opinions about using <code>geom_density</code>
instead of <code>geom_histogram</code> to visualize the bootstrap
distribution? Explain.</p></li>
<li><p>Go back to the code in the interlude that generated the picture
of the sampling distribution, and explain how it works.</p></li>
<li><p>Read this <a href="rsample">addendum about
<code>rsample</code></a>. Then explain what would need to change with
the code from the interlude that generated the picture of the sampling
distribution if you wanted to use <code>rsample</code> instead of
<code>modelr</code>.</p></li>
