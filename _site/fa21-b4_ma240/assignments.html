<h2 id="A">Daily Discord</h2>
<p><em>Instructions.</em> Participate on our Discord server. Here are
some ways you might participate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask a question you have about course material (the current reading,
a past reading, something we discussed in class, …).</li>
<li>Respond to a question someone else has posted.</li>
<li>Discuss or summarize some aspect of course material (the current
reading, a past reading, something we discussed in class, …) that you
find particularly interesting.</li>
<li>Share an example of a data visualization from the internet that you
feel exemplifies some principle of good (or bad!) design.</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Grading.</em> This “assignment” is worth 15 points. You’ll get
full credit if you post something along the above lines every day as
indicated on the assignment calendar, with at most 2 exceptions.</p>
<p><em>Other Participation.</em> Here are some other ways that you
should participate on Discord:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask and answer questions about class logistics (as opposed to course
material).</li>
<li>Add an appropriate reaction to a question that someone else has
posted to indicate that you have that question too.</li>
<li>Start up (or continue) a conversation about something fun and and
unrelated to class in the <code>#chitchat</code> channel.</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>These kinds of participation won’t contribute to your score for this
assignment, but can contribute to the “Participation” portion of your
overall grade.</p>
<h2 id="B">Weekly Reflections</h2>
<p><em>Instructions.</em> Fill out the <a
href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf6b1RnZA2GP8Cb9R5aWy_-iW9DJcZmQNjnhyby2b8LvEY_oQ/viewform">weekly
reflection form</a> every week.</p>
<p><em>Grading.</em> Each weekly reflection is worth 5 points, for a
total of 15 points. You’ll get full credit as long as you respond
sincerely to the prompts.</p>
<h2 id="C">Mathematical Autobiography</h2>
<p><em>Overview.</em> Write at least 500 words about your experiences
with mathematics (or statistics or computer science). You’re welcome to
take this in any direction you like, but if you’re having trouble
getting started, here are some questions you might ponder (and you
should feel free to replace “math” with “stats” or “computer science” or
“programming” in any of these):</p>
<ul>
<li>What early experiences do you remember having related to math?</li>
<li>What are some memorable (both good and bad) experiences you’ve had
with math?</li>
<li>Have you had any mathematical mentors who weren’t teachers in a
classroom setting (eg, parents, siblings, friends)?</li>
<li>How has your attitude towards math changed over the years?</li>
<li>What is something that feels good and/or exciting about learning
math? What do you find scary about it?</li>
<li>How does this particular math class, and math as a whole, fit into
your goals in life?</li>
<li>Do you think there’s a difference between how people would react to
someone saying “I hate math” versus to someone saying “I hate music”? If
so, why do you think that is?</li>
<li>Have you noticed any differences in attitudes towards math between
here and wherever you grew up?</li>
<li>What do you think math <em>is</em>? How would you define it for an
alien who is trying to understand what kinds of things human beings
think about and how math fits into the landscape of human inquiry?</li>
</ul>
<p><em>But why?!?</em> You likely weren’t expecting an essay in a math
class. One reason that I’m having you do this is just that I would like
to get to know you and your history with mathematics. Another reason is
that there’s research in pedagogy suggesting that reflecting on your
experiences and molding a coherent narrative out of your reflections can
be very beneficial to the learning process.</p>
<p><em>Help!</em> Remember that you have access to the <a
href="https://www.coloradocollege.edu/offices/colketcenter/writing-center/">Writing
Center</a> for help with writing assignments.</p>
<p><em>Grading.</em> This assignment is worth 10 points. I do want to be
able to understand what you’ve written, but I won’t be marking you off
for your spelling or grammar or anything of the sort. All I’m looking
for is evidence that you’ve genuinely reflected on your relationship
with math, and that you’ve put some effort into organizing your thoughts
on paper.</p>

<h2 id="I">Synthesis 1 (Summarize)</h2>
<p><em>Instructions.</em> Write up a discussion (roughly 500 words) of
one or more topics that caught your interest from your “theoretical
readings” thus far. The aim is to synthesize material from your
readings, so your discussion should make reference to more than one
work. You may do this assignment with a partner.</p>
<p>You’re welcome (and encouraged!) to supplement your discussion with
references to other works we haven’t discussed in class. Feel free to
also include your own opinions about the content from the readings; you
don’t need to agree with everything you read! Include a list of
references at the end of your paper.</p>
<p><em>Grading.</em> This assignment is worth 20 points.</p>
<h2 id="J">Synthesis 2 (Implement)</h2>
<p><em>Instructions.</em> Find a data set about something you’re
interested in and then produce one graphical representation of the data.
Then write about the graphic you’ve made (roughly 500 words),
specifically discussing the principles from the “theoretical readings”
that you’ve put into practice in generating the graphic. The aim is to
synthesize material from your readings, so your discussion should make
reference to more than one of these works. You may do this assignment
with a partner.</p>
<p>You’re welcome (and encouraged!) to supplement your discussion with
references to other works (or parts of works) that we haven’t discussed
in class. For example, we’ve only read chapter 1 of [War12], but the
rest of this book contains <em>many</em> visualization principles
grounded in perceptual psychology. All of these principles are collected
in an appendix at the end of the book. You might decide to look through
this to get some ideas.</p>
<p>If you need help finding data, check out the <a href="../data">“Data
Sources” page</a>.</p>
<p><em>Grading.</em> This assignment is worth 20 points.</p>
<h2 id="K">Synthesis 3 (Critique)</h2>
<p><em>Instructions.</em> Find at least 3 data graphics that were not in
any of our “theoretical readings” (from news websites, FiveThirtyEight,
academic papers, historical documents, …). For each of these graphics,
discuss ways in which the graphic does or doesn’t implement the
principles of good design, and how the graphic might be improved. You
should reference principles from more than one of the “theoretical
reading” references. You may do this assignment with a partner.</p>
<p>You’re welcome (and encouraged!) to supplement your discussion with
references to other works we haven’t discussed in class, and with your
own personal opinions. Make sure to include images of the graphics you
found (or links, if they’re interactive graphics).</p>
<p><em>Grading.</em> This assignment is worth 20 points.</p>
<h2 id="L">Vastopolis Epidemic</h2>
<p><em>Fictional Setup.</em> Vastopolis is a major metropolitan area
with a population of approximately two million. During the last few
days, local health professionals have noticed a dramatic increase in
reported illnesses. Observed symptoms are largely flu-­like and include
fever, chills, sweats, aches and pains, fatigue, coughing, breathing
difficulty, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, and enlarged lymph nodes.
More recently, there have been several deaths believed to be associated
with the current outbreak. City officials fear a possible epidemic and
are mobilizing emergency management resources to mitigate the impact.
You have been charged with providing an assessment of the situation.</p>
<p><em>Instructions.</em> Form a group (roughly 3 people). Study the
data provided to you by the Vastopolis city officials in <a
href="https://canvas.coloradocollege.edu/files/1261353/">this
<code>zip</code> file</a>, starting with the <code>README</code> file.
Here are some suggested tasks and questions to guide your analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mark an approximate “ground zero location” on the map (ie, the
location where the outbreak started). Explain how you arrived at your
conclusion.</p></li>
<li><p>Present a hypothesis on how the infection is being transmitted.
For example, is the method of transmission person­-to-­person, airborne,
waterborne, or something else? Identify the trends that support your
hypothesis.</p></li>
<li><p>Is the outbreak contained? Is it necessary for emergency
management personnel to deploy treatment resources outside the affected
area? Explain your reasoning.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t worry about getting the “right answers;” in fact, there might
not even be unique right answers. Instead, focus on presenting a
convincing case about what’s going on and what city officials need to do
about it.</p>
<p>Submit a standalone <code>html</code> or <code>pdf</code> file
documenting your group’s analysis. Include your code snippets in the
output file, but be judicious about what code messages/warnings/etc you
include. You should imagine that the intended audience for this document
is Vastopolis city officials.</p>
<p><em>Grading.</em> This assignment is worth 20 points.</p>
<p><em>Possible suggestions.</em> Feel free to ignore everything here
and do things your own way! But here are some things you might consider
to get things going:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Are all of the <code>Created_at</code> timestamps in
<code>microblogs.csv</code> <em>actually</em> timestamps? The functions
<code>parse_datetime</code> and/or <code>separate</code> might be useful
for tidying this data. See [WG17, Chapter 11–12].</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>microblogs.csv</code> file is quite large, so working
with the entire <code>tibble</code> can get a little tedious. Consider
working with a smaller random sample until your code is ready to work
with the whole data set. The function <code>slice_sample</code> can do
this for you:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>microblogs <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">read_csv</span>(<span class="st">&quot;microblogs.csv&quot;</span>) <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span> </span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="fu">slice_sample</span>(<span class="at">n =</span> <span class="dv">50</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This takes a sample of size 50 from the <code>csv</code> file. Feel
free to chance the 50 if you’d rather work with a sample of a different
size. If you don’t know what’s going on with the above line of code,
this is probably a good time to review data import and pipes [WG17,
Chapters <a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-import.html">11</a> and <a
href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/pipes.html">18</a>].</p></li>
<li><p>Here’s some schematic code for overlaying plots on the
<code>map.png</code> file:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre

<p>This data was prepared by Georges Grinstein, Kristin Cook, Paul
Havig, Kristen Liggett, Bohdan Nebesh, Mark Whiting, Kirsten Whitley,

</div>
<h2 id="M">Final Project</h2>
<p><em>Instructions.</em> Form a group of roughly 3 people. Find some
raw data of interest to you. If you need help finding data, check out
the <a href="../data">“Data Sources” page</a>. (Note that you might need
to extract data from several different data files to be able to answer
interesting questions!) Study this data using visualizations, and
prepare a document explaining what you found. Then prepare a brief and
informal presentation for the class where you share the visualizations
you’ve produced and talk about what they reveal.</p>
<p>Feel free to organize your document in a way that makes sense for the
data you’re analyzing, but you should make sure to include the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A description of the structure of the data as you found it, and of
the process you went through to tidy it.</li>
<li>At least one graphic which depictes three of more variables, and at
least one which depicts uncertainty (eg, confidence intervals
constructed using bootstrapping). Feel free to include any other plots
that you found helpful in making sense of the data.</li>
<li>For each graphic you make, you should have a discussion of what
pattern in the data the graphic reveals, as well as a discussion of your
design choices for the graphic (eg, by citing principles from the
“theoretical readings” that you’ve chosen to implement in that
graphic).</li>
</ul>
<p>Submit a standalone <code>html</code> or <code>pdf</code> file
through the “Assignment Submission” Google Form (no <code>Rmd</code>
this time, since I won’t be able to compile this myself). Include code
snippets in the output file, but be judicious about what
messages/warnings/etc you include. Include a list of references to any
works you cite or use (including a reference to where you found the
data).</p>
<p><em>Grading.</em> This assignment is worth 30 points.</p>
