<h1 id="quizzes">Quizzes</h1>
<h2 id="general">General Information</h2>
<p>See the <a href="syllabus#quizzes">syllabus</a> for general
information about quizzes.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Resources: In general, the only resource you are allowed is one
two-sided handwritten sheet of notes on quizzes. In particular, no
calculators or computers are allowed; you should be prepared to have to
do a small amount of mental arithmetic.</p></li>
<li><p>Content: Quizzes will be cumulative, but the emphasis will be on
new material not previously tested. The content of the quizzes is
indicated below.</p></li>
<li><p>Format: In general, quizzes will take place in person during
class as indicated on the <a href="index#schedule">schedule</a>. You
will have 80 minutes.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Below you’ll find information about quiz corrections. Specific
information about particular quizzes (eg, any exceptions to the above
generalities) is noted further below.</p>
<h2 id="q1">Quiz 1</h2>
<p>It’ll cover through 2.6. There’ll be 8 questions.</p>
<h2 id="q2">Quiz 2</h2>
<p>It’ll cover through 2.14. There’ll be 8 questions.</p>
<h2 id="q3">Quiz 3</h2>
<p>It’ll cover through 3.9. There’ll be 8 questions.</p>
<h2 id="q4">Quiz 4</h2>
<p>It’ll cover through 4.5 (but no 3.10). There’ll be 8 questions. The
last question on the quiz will be slightly peculiar in that it will
require you do to some advance preparation. Please make sure to do the
preparation described below in advance; during the quiz, you’ll be on
your own and you won’t have access to technology!</p>
<p>Here is a plaintext file containing some ciphertext that was
encrypted using a simple substitution:</p>
<p><a href="q4-cipher.txt"><code>q4-cipher.txt</code></a></p>
<p>The corresponding plaintext is known to contain
<code>OKLAHOMA</code>. Decrypt this ciphertext. Once you’ve decrypted
it, write down the decryption key on your sheet of notes. You may work
with your classmates to decrypt this text, and if you do, you should
also write down the names of everyone who you worked with and/or got
help from on your sheet of notes.</p>
<p>You will use the information you’ve written down on your sheet of
notes to answer Problem 8 on Quiz 4, which will begin as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Problem 8.</strong> The next page contains some ciphertext
that was encrypted using a simple substitution; it is the same
ciphertext that was made available to you in the
<code>q4-cipher.txt</code> file last week. Using the same key that
decrypts that ciphertext…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You have permission to discuss this problem with each other on Zulip,
but I request that you only give each other <em>suggestions</em> on
Zulip; please don’t reveal the answer there outright. If you get help
from your classmates through Zulip, please still make sure to write down
the names of everyone who helped on your sheet of notes.</p>
<h2 id="corrections">Quiz Corrections</h2>
<p>After each quiz (but not the final exam), you will be able to do
corrections to earn back some points that you missed. The maximum number
of points you can earn back is capped at 10% of the total number of
points on the quiz. You will earn back 0.5 points for each problem that
you “correct,” where correcting a problem means writing up thorough
responses to all of the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
<li>
What is the correct solution? (Write it out completely! Do not refer
back to your quiz.)
</li>
<li>
What specifically was incorrect about your solution on the quiz? What
are the key concepts involved in this problem that you didn’t understand
at the time?
</li>
<li>
What resources did you use to help you get to the correct solution?
</li>
</ol>
<p>You can use any resources you like (classmates, instructor, TA,
office hours, …) as long as you acknowledge them under item (c) as
indicated above, but your responses to all of the questions should
ultimately be written up in your own words.</p>
<p>Deadlines are indicated on the <a href="index#schedule">schedule</a>.
Submit your corrections through Gradescope. If you submit a single PDF,
please <em>make sure</em> to correctly “<a
href="https://help.gradescope.com/article/ccbpppziu9-student-submit-work">assign
pages</a>” to your submission.</p>
<h1 id="final">Final Exam</h1>
<p>It’ll take place on Thu 6/13 at 8am, and you will have 3 hours (180
minutes). It’ll cover everything (except 3.10). There will be 16
problems, and 5 of them will involve concepts introduced in 4.6 onwards.
The only resource you will be allowed is one two-sided handwritten sheet
of notes.</p>
<p>In other words, you should expect roughly a “double quiz,” but the
proportion of problems that cover strictly new material is less than has
been typical of quizzes. Things you might study include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Problems from the notes.</li>
<li>Problems from the in-class slides.</li>
<li>Problems from previous quizzes.</li>
</ul>
