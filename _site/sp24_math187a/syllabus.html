<h2 id="course-overview">Course Overview</h2>
<h3 id="content">Content</h3>
<p>This course is an introduction to <em>cryptography</em>, the art and
science of secure communication. We’ll study some classical
cryptosystems, such as rectangular transposition, the Caesar cipher, the
Polybius square, and the Vignère cipher, as well as methods for breaking
these cryptosystems. We’ll also study some modern cryptosystems, such as
RSA, ElGamal, Diffie-Hellman key exchange, and elliptic curve
cryptography. Along the way, we’ll encounter a wide array of mathematics
useful in cryptography, including some number theory, probability
theory, information theory, and algebraic geometry.</p>
<h3 id="non-content">Non-Content</h3>
<p>This course is <em>not</em> about cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin ☺</p>
<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
<p>Formally, the only prerequisite for the course is Math 10A or 20A,
but we won’t make much use of calculus. Some basic programming
experience could be useful, but it’s also not required. An eagerness to
learn is sufficient!</p>
<h2 id="course-materials">Course Materials</h2>
<h3 id="textbook">Textbook</h3>
<p>I do not know of any single textbook that contains all of the
material that we will discuss in this class at the level we will discuss
it. Your primary reference will be the “<a href="/crypt/">Introduction
to Cryptography</a>” notes that I starting preparing the last time I
taught this class (and I will update this time around based on comments
from you all!). You are welcome and encouraged to supplement with <a
href="resources">other resources</a> as you go along.</p>
<h3 id="zulip">Zulip</h3>
<p>Zulip is chat software (a bit like Discord, Slack, or Piazza), and it
will be our primary means of communication for this class. It’s
open-source and you can use it in a browser or by installing an app on
any platform. I’ve set up a <a
href="https://sunnysclasses.zulipchat.com/">Zulip organization</a> with
a dedicated stream for our class. You can find an invite link on Canvas.
Register using any name you’d like to use for this class, but you
<em>must</em> use your official <code>...@ucsd.edu</code> email address
as it appears on the class roster. If you don’t have access to the
invite link or you don’t have a <code>...@ucsd.edu</code> email address,
please reach out to me to explain the situation.</p>
<p>Use the Zulip class stream to ask any content-related and
logistics-related questions you have. Certain assignments for the course
will ask you to post things to our class stream regularly. I will also
use Zulip to make class-related announcements. If you have private
questions about situations specific to you, please use Zulip to send
direct messages (instead of emails or Canvas messages, which I may not
respond to).</p>
<h3 id="sagemath">SageMath</h3>
<p>SageMath (or just “Sage” for short) is a thin wrapper for the popular
programming language Python. It makes mathematical computations
especially convenient, and you’ll be encouraged to play with Sage during
this course.</p>
<p>You can run Sage in many ways. The “<a href="/crypt">Introduction to
Cryptography</a>” notes contains numerous SageCells with some
pre-written code. You can modify the code in any of those SageCells, or
you can even clear it out completely and start from scratch. You can
also start from a <a href="https://sagecell.sagemath.org/">blank
SageCell</a> (or you can use <a href="https://cocalc.com">CoCalc</a>).
Your can also <a
href="https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/index.html">install
Sage</a> and run the code locally on your computer; your code will run
fastest if you do this, but it will require some setup on your part.</p>
<h2 id="course-structure">Course Structure</h2>
<h3 id="philosophy">Philosophy</h3>
<p>No class (or classes) will ever teach you everything you might need
to know about a subject. In the long run, the most important thing to
learn is how to learn independently: in pedagogical jargon, that’s “how
to be a <em>self-regulated learner</em>.” Research in education suggests
that the following three things are key aspects of learning how to be a
self-regulated learner of math:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><em>Active reading</em>. Reading math can be very different from
other kinds of reading. You have to stop constantly to work out
exercises and examples yourself, instead of just reading through them.
You have to doodle pictures to make sure you have some kind of an image
in your head of what’s going on. You have to try to formulate
<em>precise</em> questions about things you don’t understand.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Reciprocal teaching</em>. Talking to your peers about math is
important. If you don’t understand a particular concept, you’re more
likely to get an explanation that you actually find helpful from a peer.
If you think you do understand a particular concept and help a peer
who’s struggling, you’ll almost certainly find that the process of
explaining the concept will solidify your own understanding of it.
Learning happens best in community, and it is in your best interest to
make sure you have a mathematical community.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Metacognition</em>. A key part of learning how to learn is
reflecting on your learning and taking the time to ask yourself
questions about your learning. What parts of your study habits are
working well for you? What parts aren’t working and how can you change
these parts? What kind of a mindset do you have towards math, and what
can you be doing to help cultivate a growth mindset in
yourself?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Practicing these three things is built into course structure. It may
benefit you to bear these three things in mind as you go through the
course.</p>
<h3 id="class">Class</h3>
<p>This class will be mostly “flipped.” You’ll be expected to read and
make a preliminary attempt to understand material on your own before
coming to class. I’ll typically start class off with a brief summary of
your latest reading. It will not be a substitute for having done the
reading, and you shouldn’t expect “lectures.” We’ll usually spend most
of our time working on problems together.</p>
<p>Attendance is strongly encouraged, but it is not required. The class
will not be podcasted.</p>
<h3 id="assignments">Assignments</h3>
<p>There will be a few different types of assignments in the course,
including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="read">Reading Assignments</a>: These involve reading
something, attempting some exercises, and formulating a question about
the reading. One of these will be due before most class
sessions.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="reflect">Reflection Assignments</a>: These ask you to
reflect on various aspects of your relationship with mathematics, your
mathematical learning, etc. You’ll have about 1 of these due every
week.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Assignment deadlines are indicated on the <a
href="index#schedule">schedule</a>. Late assignments will not be
accepted.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="quizzes">Quizzes</h3>
<p>There will be <a href="quiz">quizzes</a> roughly every other week, as
indicated on the calendar. There will be no make-up quizzes.</p>
<h3 id="final-exam">Final Exam</h3>
<p>The <a href="quiz#final">final exam</a> will be held on Thursday,
June 13, 8–11am. There will be no make-up exam.</p>
<h2 id="assessment">Assessment</h2>

<p>At the end of the quarter, I may decide to lower some of the above
cutoffs, but I will not increase them.</p>
<h2 id="accommodations">Accommodations</h2>
<p>If you experience disability-related barriers to your learning,
please contact the <a href="https://osd.ucsd.edu/">Office for Students
with Disabilities</a> right away to have them provide a current
Authorization for Accommodation (AFA). The AFA should be received at
least one week in advance of the requested accommodations, and ideally
by the end of the first week of classes. We may be unable to accommodate
late requests.</p>
<h2 id="integrity">Integrity</h2>
<p>Act with integrity. You’ll learn more, and you’ll be practicing good
habits for ethical decisions that you’ll have to make for the rest of
your life. If you have a question about whether something class-related
is integrous, just ask first. Academic integrity violations have to be
reported and result in serious consequences, none of which is any fun
for anyone involved — so please, just don’t do it.</p>
<h2 id="diversity">Diversity</h2>
<p>The pursuit of knowledge thrives in diverse and inclusive
environments. I expect that all of us, myself included, will work
towards making our class a welcoming space for everyone, no matter how
we might identify on race, ethnicity, nationality, socioeconomic
background, gender, sexual orientation, ability, age, and the many other
dimensions of identity. I also encourage you to reach out if there are
ways to have our space be more comfortable for you. If anyone says
anything in class that makes you feel unwelcome, please let me know.</p>
