<h1 id="final-reflection">Final Reflection</h1>
<p>Write up responses for each of the following (roughly 200-300
each).</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Interpretting statistics.</strong> In your own words,
summarize the contents of the <a href="index#week-4-monday">two
articles</a> you were asked to read on Week 4 Monday.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Creativity.</strong> Give an example of an idea from this
class that you found creative (or just “cool”), and explain what you
find creative about it. Explain the idea briefly as you would explain it
to someone who hasn’t taken any statistics before. You could describe a
particular technique that you learned that you found to be creative, or
you could describe an instance of creativity you experienced in your own
problem-solving (or someone else’s).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Meta-learning.</strong> This block, you were asked to
fill out weekly forms in which you reflected on your (mathematical)
learning habits. In these forms, you told me about what you were doing
to learn things, what you weren’t doing, what you were hoping to change
about your learning habits, etc. Describe one thing you learned about
your learning habits this block. Did you discover that you weren’t doing
something that maybe you should have been doing, or that you were doing
something that you shouldn’t have been doing? If you set a goal for
yourself to change one of your learning habits and followed through on
it, what did you find?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Persistence.</strong> Take one specific problem you
worked on this block that you struggled to understand and solve, and
explain how the struggle itself was valuable. In the context of this
question, describe the struggle and how you overcame it. Did you have a
“eureka!” moment, and if so, what seemed to bring it about? You might
also discuss whether struggling built aspects of character in you
(endurance, self-confidence, growth mindset, etc). How might these
virtues might benefit you in later ventures?</p></li>
