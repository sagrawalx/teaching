<h1 id="syllabus">Syllabus</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Statistical thinking will one day be as necessary for efficient
citizenship as the ability to read or write. <span

</blockquote>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>MA117 is an introduction to statistics, the practice of collecting,
analyzing, and interpreting data. En route, the course will cover some
concepts from probability which form the mathematical backbone of
statistical analysis. The course will also involve using R, a
programming language that statisticians use ubiquitously today.</p>
<h2 id="things-youll-need">Things you’ll need</h2>
<h3 id="textbook">Textbook</h3>
<p>We’ll use an open-source textbook called <a
href="https://www.openintro.org/book/os/">OpenIntro Statistics</a>. You
can download a PDF from the website (for whatever price you like,
including $0). You can also purchase a paper copy if you prefer.</p>
<h3 id="rstudio">RStudio</h3>
<p>We’ll be using R for this course. There are two ways of doing
this:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">Installing R</a> and then <a
href="https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download">installing
RStudio</a> (in that order!), or</li>
<li>Using <a href="https://rstudio.cloud">rstudio.cloud</a> in a
browser.</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter is easier to set up. But, the last time I taught the
class, a few students had some minor issues with rstudio.cloud that
students using a desktop version didn’t have. The issues didn’t really
impede students’ ability to complete work (they just had to find some
workarounds), and maybe rstudio.cloud has finessed these issues since
then. In any case, my recommendation would be that you try to install
RStudio on your computer if that’s at all possible.</p>
<p>If you have trouble installing R and/or RStudio, your best bet is to
get in touch with ITS for help. If that still doesn’t work, you can use
rstudio.cloud in browser, but just be aware that things might
occasionally not work as you expect and feel free to ask for help when
you need it.</p>
<p>If you don’t have access to a computer that you can use for R at all
(ie, you can’t install R + RStudio and you can’t use rstudio.cloud in a
browser), let me know and we’ll try to figure something out.</p>
<h2 id="mechanics">Mechanics</h2>
<h3 id="readings">Readings</h3>
<p>The <a href="index#calendar">calendar</a> indicates sections from the
textbook for each day. You’ll read those sections and then submit a
“comprehension check” and a “reading question” by 8am MT on the day
indicated on the calendar.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For the “comprehension check,” you’ll attempt to solve the <a
href="index#readings-and-problems">problems marked “CC”</a> from each
section that you read. You’ll get credit as long as I can see that you
put in a sincere effort on these problems. You’re encouraged to check
your solutions for correctness yourself, by comparing against the
solutions in the back of the textbook.</p></li>
<li><p>You’ll formulate a “reading question” about what you read and
submit it using a Google Form. Try to formulate questions as precisely
as you can. If you didn’t understand something in the reading, pinpoint
exactly what it was that you didn’t understand. If you couldn’t solve a
comprehension check problem, that could make for a good reading question
as well; tell me what you got stuck on and why you got stuck.</p>
<p>If you don’t have any questions about the reading, your question
might be a non-question. For example, you might tell me about a question
that you had but then managed to figure out. Or you might tell me about
something that you understand but that you think your peers might find
confusing. I’m mostly looking for an indication that you did the
assigned reading and made a sincere attempt to process it.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that, depending on your time zone and sleep schedule, the 8am MT
deadline might mean that you have to complete the assignment the day
before the deadline indicated on the calendar. Deadlines will be strict,
so please get things submitted on time.</p>
<p>I will look through your questions and then make one or more short
videos and/or documents summarizing what I think are the highlights from
the reading and also trying to answer some of your questions. Please
note that these videos are not intended to be substitutes for doing the
reading! They’ll just be discussions of a few important and/or confusing
points from the reading.</p>
<h3 id="worksheets-and-further-practice-problems">Worksheets and Further
Practice problems</h3>
<p>There will be worksheet and/or further practice (“FP”) problems
associated to each reading. These will not be collected. That being
said, some quiz and final exam problems will resemble these problems, so
you are encouraged to do as many of them as you can. I also encourage
you to work with your classmates on these problems.</p>
<p>You’ll find solutions to odd-numbered exercises in the textbook. I
won’t be posting solutions to the worksheets or the even-numbered
exercises, but you’re welcome to ask me or Fernando or Cinea or QRC
tutors about anything you’re struggling with!</p>
<h3 id="quizzes-and-the-final-exam">Quizzes and the Final Exam</h3>
<p>There will be three quizzes and a final exam.</p>
<p>The quizzes will be accessible to you through Gradescope 24 hours
before their final deadlines (Fridays at 2pm). You are welcome to take
the quiz at any time of day that works best for you. You are allotted 1
hour to work on quizzes.</p>
<p>Note that, once you access the document through Gradescope, the
website will be require you to submit your work within 3 hours (but it
must be suubmitted before the 2pm deadline). I entrust to the Honor Code
that you won’t spend more than the allotted 1 hour on the quiz. The
extra time is there for unusual situations (eg, if you run into
technical problems in uploading your work, or if you’ve arranged for
extra time accommodations with Accessibility Resources). Gradescope’s
2pm deadline and 3-hour limit will be strict, so please make sure you
get things in on time.</p>
<p>The format for the final exam will be roughly the same as that of the
quizzes, except it’ll be roughly twice as long. You’ll have 2 hours to
work on it, and you’ll have to finish submitting the file within 5 hours
after you access the document (but still before the final
deadline!).</p>
<h3 id="quiz-revisions">Quiz Revisions</h3>
<p>After the quizzes are graded, you’ll have a chance to do some
revisions. You can earn up to 2 points on your quiz by doing this, on
any problem(s) you’d like. If you’d like to do this, send me an email
within 72 hours after the quizzes are graded with the following
information:</p>
<ul>
<li>What problem(s) are you wanting to to revise?</li>
<li>Describe your mistake. What went wrong? Why did things go
wrong?</li>
<li>What is the correct solution? Make sure to explain things
fully.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also note that this is just for the quizzes; there won’t be any
revisions for the final exam.</p>
<h3 id="labs">Labs</h3>
<p>There will be a number of labs over the course of the block. These
will require you to use R to analyze some data and answer some
questions. You should respond to each question as completely as you can.
If answering a question requires you have to write some code that isn’t
explicitly given to you in the lab directions, include your code. If you
generate a plot in the process of answering a question, include that
plot.</p>
<h3 id="project">Project</h3>
<p>There will be a <a href="project">project</a>. The final product is
due at the end of the block, but there will be some preliminary
deadlines as well.</p>
<h3 id="self-reflection">Self-reflection</h3>
<p>Research in pedagogy shows that a key part of learning is taking the
time to ask yourself questions about your learning. I’d like to
encourage you to take the time to do this kind of reflection, and there
will be a number of assignments throughout the course with this goal in
mind.</p>
<h3 id="live-events">Live events</h3>
<p>There will be a few different types of live events:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Introduction session: This will happen only on the first day.
It’ll be a chance for all of us to see each other’s faces, get to know
each other, ask questions about the syllabus, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Group sessions: Starting from 1st Tuesday, there will be a “group
session” every day 10–10:30am MT (the end time is flexible). I’ve
generated some random numbers to draw a set of names for each day. If
your name is drawn on a particular day, you should show up on that day.
You do not need to show up on other days (but you can if you like!).
Things are set up so that your name should be drawn roughly once a
week.</p>
<p>These group sessions are for you to talk to each other about whatever
you’re struggling with, and I can chime in whenever necessary. This
means that you should come with a question or two that you would like to
discuss with the group!</p>
<p>If you won’t be able to make it to a group session on a day that your
name has been drawn for, please let me know in advance and we’ll work
something out.</p></li>
<li><p>Problem sessions: Fernando will hold problem sessions thrice a
week. You might use these to talk to your classmates and to get help
from Fernando on labs or whatever else you’re struggling with!</p></li>
<li><p>Office hours:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’ll have office hours for you to stop by and ask me for help with
whatever you need.</li>
<li>The math paraprof, Cinea, also holds office hours Monday through
Friday, 9am–5pm MT. You should email her to let her know if there are
things you’d like to ask her.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>I strongly encourage you to set up live study sessions with your
classmates on your own as well. I’ve set us up a Slack workspace that
you might use to coordinate live study sessions; you can also use it to
ask each other questions via chat. It can be easy to feel isolated
during this era of quarantines and social distancing, but you do have
access to a community (which includes your classmates, me, Cinea,
Fernando, and QRC tutors). Taking advantage of this community will help
you feel less isolated, and also help your learning.</p>
<h2 id="assessment">Assessment</h2>
<p>Grades will be calculated as follows.</p>

</table>
<p>Here are further details about some of these components.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Reading questions</em>. You get 1 point for each reading
question you submit, up to a maximum of <span
class="math inline">\(n-2\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the number of days a reading is
assigned. In other words, you don’t need to submit a reading question
every day to get full credit, and there’s no extra credit for doing
so.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Comprehension checks</em>. You get 1 point for each problem
you attempt, up to a maximum of <span
class="math inline">\(n-10\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the total number of comprehension
check problems that are assigned. In other words, you don’t need to
submit comprehension checks every day to get full credit, and there’s no
extra credit for going above the requirements.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Reflection assignments</em>. This is for all of the
reflection assignments (mathematical autobiography, weekly reflections,
etc).</p></li>
<li><p><em>Participation</em>. You’ll get a full score for the
participation component of your grade as long as I can see that you are
putting in a good faith effort to engage with the class.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="accommodations">Accommodations</h2>

<li id="fn1"><p>This appears to be a false attribution — or rather, it
is a paraphrase. In <em>Mankind in the Making</em> (1903), H. G. Wells
writes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The great body of physical science, a great deal of the essential
fact of financial science, and endless social and political problems are
only accessible and only thinkable to those who have had a sound
training in mathematical analysis, and the time may not be very remote
when it will be understood that for complete initiation as an efficient
citizen of one of the new great complex world-wide States that are now
developing, it is as necessary to be able to compute, to think in
averages and maxima and minima, as it is now to be able to read and
write.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was later paraphrased by Samuel S. Wilks in his presidential
address to the American Statistical Association in 1950 in the form
quoted at the top of this syllabus, and this paraphrase has spread under
Wells’s name since then.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"
