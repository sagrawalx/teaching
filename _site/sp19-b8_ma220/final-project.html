<h1 id="final-project">Final Project</h1>
<h2 id="objective">Objective</h2>
<p>The goal of this project is to give you chance to explore a topic of
your interest that has some connection to linear algebra, and to share
what you learn with your peers. It can be something purely mathematical,
or it can involve an application of linear algebra to an area of your
choice.</p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>You’ll form groups of 2-4 and collectively choose a topic you want to
work on. Your group and topic will need to be approved by me: one person
in each proposed group should send me an email letting me know who
you’ll be working with and what you’ll be working on, by 11:59pm on the
third Tuesday.</p>
<p>For the last day of class, you’ll prepare a handout and a digital
presentation about your topic.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The handout should be one typewritten page (front and back). It
should give an introduction to the topic, and incorporate a detailed and
substantial proof and/or example. It need not be entirely original (ie,
you don’t need to prove a brand new theorem about linear algebra), but
it should be fully explained <em>in your own words</em>. If you can
incorporate the results of some computer calculations, that would be
awesome! The handout should also include a list of works that you
referenced, so that someone who wants to learn more about your topic
knows where to start.</p>
<p>Bring some copies of your handout to the presentation (at least one
for me, and then a few more in case any of your peers would like to take
one).</p></li>
<li><p>The presentation should convey the main ideas of your topic and
some insightful examples. It should take about 10 minutes. We’ll use the
big data visualization wall in the library, and you can format the
presentation however you like (slides, a giant digital poster, …).
Pictures and videos are always nice, if at all possible, but remember
that, if you don’t make it yourself, you have to attribute it to whoever
did. All of the nitty gritty mathematical details do not need to appear
during the presentation (that’s what the handout is for), but make sure
you do incorporate some mathematical content at least at a high level.
You should be prepared to answer any questions me or your peers might
have, after your presentation is over.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind that the intended audience is one of your classmates:
someone who knows something about the topics in linear algebra that
we’ve discussed in our class, but may not know anything specific about
your topic.</p>
<p>I encourage you to use TeX to typeset mathematics. It’s not too hard
to get used to, and will probably be useful for you in the long run.</p>
<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
<p>Your project score will be based on the following criteria.</p>
<ul>
<li>Content (out of 4 points). There should be correct and substantial
mathematical content involved (during the presentation, or on the
handout).</li>
<li>Clarity (out of 3 points). The topic should be clearly explained and
logically organized, in a way that is appropriate for the intended
audience.</li>
<li>Participation (out of 3 points). You’ll get full credit on
participation if it is clear that everyone in the group understands the
topic at the same level (in particular, everyone should have a
substantial role in the presentation).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="possible-topics">Possible Topics</h2>
<p>There are <em>so many</em> possibilities! I encourage you to be
creative. I only ask that it not be something that we’ve spent time
discussing as a class. If you’re not majoring in math, I’m almost
certain you’ll be able to find an application of linear algbera to
whatever field you are majoring in. If you do plan on majoring in math,
there is plenty of linear algebra to explore beyond what we’ve discussed
in this class.</p>
<p>If you’re struggling to find things, you probably haven’t looked :P
Here’s a short list of things to get you going. I’ll keep adding to this
list as I think of more.</p>
<ul>
<li>Perspective and projective geometry.</li>
<li>Computer graphics.</li>
<li>Electrical networks.</li>
<li>Coupled oscillators.</li>
<li>Stress tensors.</li>
<li>Algorithms for computations in linear algebra (for calculating
determinants, or for matrix multiplication, or…).</li>
<li>Page ranking.</li>
<li>Linear support vector machines.</li>
<li>Leontief input-output model.</li>
<li>Lines of best fit.</li>
<li>Markov chains.</li>
<li>Singular value decomposition.</li>
<li>Jordan form.</li>
</ul>
