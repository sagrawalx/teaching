<h1 id="notes-about-a-few-exercises">Notes about a few exercises</h1>
<p>These are not intended to be solutions. Just some thoughts.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>(1.1.105) You can use the method of example 1.1.4. Alternatively,
note that this equation is separable.</p></li>
<li><p>(1.2.102) This equation is separable. The general solution of
<span class="math inline">\(y&#39; = xy\)</span> is of the form <span
class="math inline">\(y = Ce^{x^2/2}\)</span> for some constant <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>(1.2.103) Solving this differential equation (ignoring the
initial value condition) just involves taking an antiderivative. You can
take this antiderivative using partial fractions.</p></li>
<li><p>(1.2.105) Note that, if the initial condition was of the form
<span class="math inline">\(y(0) = a\)</span> for some <span
class="math inline">\(a &gt; 0\)</span>, then the constant function
<span class="math inline">\(y \equiv a\)</span> is a solution. If the
initial condition was of the form <span class="math inline">\(y(0) =
a\)</span> for some <span class="math inline">\(a &lt; 0\)</span>, then
the function <span class="math inline">\(y = x + a\)</span> is a
solution <em>in an interval containing <span class="math inline">\(x =
0\)</span></em>.</p>
<p>Note also that, not only is there not a continuously differentiable
solution when the initial condition is <span class="math inline">\(y(0)
= 0\)</span>, there is just no solution whatsoever (more precisely, I
mean that there is no differentiable function defined on an interval
containing <span class="math inline">\(x = 0\)</span> that satisfies the
differential equation). This is a consequence of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darboux%27s_theorem_%28analysis%29">Darboux’s
theorem</a>. If you’ve taken some real analysis, I encourage you to work
out the details and write up a formal <span
class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span>-<span
class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> proof.</p></li>
<li><p>(1.2.7) Possible hint: if <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>
is a solution of the ODE <span class="math inline">\(y&#39; =
f(x,y)\)</span>, consider the function <span
class="math inline">\(h\)</span> defined by <span
class="math inline">\(h(x) = g(x) - x\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>(1.3.107) Possible hint: partial fractions.</p></li>
<li><p>(1.4.104) This equation is linear, but it’s also separable. To
get more practice, try solving it both ways!</p></li>
