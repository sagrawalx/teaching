<h2 id="one">Introduction to R and RStudio</h2>
<p>The goal of this lab is to introduce you to R and RStudio, which
you’ll be using throughout the course both to learn the statistical
concepts discussed in the texbook and also to analyze real data and come
to informed conclusions. To straighten out which is which: R is the name
of the programming language itself and RStudio is a convenient
interface. As the labs progress, you are encouraged to explore beyond
what the labs dictate; a willingness to experiment will make you a much
better programmer.</p>
<p>This lab will begin with the fundamental building blocks of R and
RStudio: the interface, reading in data, and basic commands.</p>
<p><img width="100%" src="interface.png"/></p>
<p>The panel in the upper right contains your workspace as well as a
history of the commands that you’ve previously entered. Any plots that
you generate will show up in the panel in the lower right corner.</p>
<p>The panel on the left is called the console. This is where the action
happens. Everytime you launch RStudio, it will have the same text
telling you the version of R that you’re running. Below that is the
prompt, which is a request for a command. Interacting with R is all
about typing commands and interpreting the output. These commands and
their syntax have evolved over decades (literally) and now provide what
many users feel is a fairly natural way to access data and organize,
describe, and invoke statistical computations.</p>
<h3 id="tidyverse">Tidyverse</h3>
<p>The <code>tidyverse</code> is a collection of R packages that help
significantly with many data-related tasks. We’ll be using the
<code>tidyverse</code> packages in these labs, so you’ll need to install
them. To do this, type the following into the console:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">install.packages</span>(<span class="st">&quot;tidyverse&quot;</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>It’ll take some time to install all of the packages and their
dependencies, so you can step away from your computer and grab a coffee
while it works. There should be a “DONE” on the screen when it
finishes.</p>
<p>After you install the packages, every time you start a new session
you’ll need to tell R that you’ll be using the <code>tidyverse</code>
packages. Type the following into the console to tell R that you’ll
doing this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">library</span>(tidyverse)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Remember that you’ll need to type <code>library(tidyverse)</code>
every time you start a new session of R! If you ever try running a
command over the course of the labs and R tells you that it can’t find a
function or object, you’re likely trying to invoke a
<code>tidyverse</code> object and forgot to type
<code>library(tidyverse)</code> into the console. (Note that you don’t
need to <code>install.packages("tidyverse")</code> every time.)</p>
<h3 id="arbuthnots-baptism-records">Arbuthnot’s Baptism Records</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Arbuthnot">Dr
Arbuthnot</a> (1667–1735) was a physician, writer, and mathematician. He
was interested in the ratio of newborn boys to newborn girls, so he
gathered the baptism records for children born in London for every year
from 1629 to 1710.</p>
<p>This data is recorded in the <a
href="https://sagrawalx.github.io/teaching/data/arbuthnot.csv"><code>arbuthnot.csv</code></a>
file. The <code>csv</code> extension for “comma-separated values,” and a
<code>csv</code> file is just a plain text file format used to record
data frames. The first line in the file records the variable names
(separated by commas), and then each subsequent row records observations
(again, separated by commas). The first few lines in
<code>arbuthnot.csv</code> look like this:</p>
<pre><code>year,boys,girls
1629,5218,4683
1630,4858,4457
1631,4422,4102
1632,4994,4590</code></pre>
<p>To load the data frame into R, enter the following command into R
prompt:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>arbuthnot <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">read_csv</span>(<span class="st">&quot;https://sagrawalx.github.io/teaching/data/arbuthnot.csv&quot;</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>read_csv</code> function tells R to read the
<code>csv</code> file whose path is provided inside the brackets and
quotes as a tibble (which is the modern <code>tidyverse</code> version
of the data frame). That path can be a path to a <code>csv</code> file
on your computer (eg,
<code>read_csv("~/Downloads/arbuthnot.csv")</code>), or it can be a URL
of a <code>csv</code> file on the web (like above). The
<code>&lt;-</code> symbol tells R to store the data from that
<code>csv</code> file into a variable called <code>arbuthnot</code>.</p>
<p>You should see that the workspace area in the upper righthand corner
of the RStudio window now lists a tibble called <code>arbuthnot</code>
that has 82 observations on 3 variables. You can take a look at the
tibble by typing its name into the console.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>arbuthnot</span></code></pre></div>
<p>R will show you something like this:</p>
<pre><code># A tibble: 82 × 3
    year  boys girls
   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;
 1  1629  5218  4683
 2  1630  4858  4457
 3  1631  4422  4102
 4  1632  4994  4590
 5  1633  5158  4839
 6  1634  5035  4820
 7  1635  5106  4928
 8  1636  4917  4605
 9  1637  4703  4457
10  1638  5359  4952
# … with 72 more rows</code></pre>
<p>The first line tells you how many rows and columns the tibble has
(namely, 82 and 3). Below that, you see the first 10 rows of the data.
Each row represents a year, namely, the year specified under the
<code>year</code> heading. The second and third columns record the
number of boys and girls, respectively, that were baptized that
year.</p>
<p>Note that under the column headings, you see some
<code>&lt;dbl&gt;</code>s. The <code>dbl</code> stands for “double,”
which is what R calls numbers. The <code>&lt;dbl&gt;</code> under each
column heading tells you that the <code>read_csv</code> function read
all of the columns as columns of doubles. This is reasonable for this
data, and usually <code>read_csv</code> will make a reasonable decision.
(In the rare situation that it doesn’t make a good decision, there are
ways you can tell <code>read_csv</code> how you want to read the
data.)</p>
<p>The final line of the output above reminds you that you’re seeing a
truncation of the data, and that the tibble really has 72 more lines
that you’re not seeing. If you’d like to see the full tibble, you have
two options. You can either double-click on the name of the tibble in
the Environment pane (the box on the upper right-hand side) of the
RStudio interface, or you can type the following into the console:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">view</span>(arbuthnot)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Let’s start to examine the data a little more closely. We can access
the data in a single column of the tibble separately using the
<code>$</code>. For example, to get a list of the numbers of boys that
were baptized each year, type the following into the console:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>arbuthnot<span class="sc">$</span>boys</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Notice that the way R has printed these data is different. When we
looked at the complete data frame, we saw 82 rows, one on each line of
the display. These data are no longer structured in a table with other
variables, so they are displayed one right after another. Objects that
print out in this way are called <em>vectors</em>; they represent a set
of numbers. R has added numbers in [brackets] along the left side of the
printout to indicate locations within the vector. For example,
<code>5218</code> follows <code>[1]</code>, indicating that
<code>5218</code> is the first entry in the vector. And if
<code>[43]</code> starts a line, then that would mean the first number
on that line would represent the 43rd entry in the vector.</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>What command would you use to extract just the counts of girls
baptized? Try it!</p>
</div>
<h3 id="scatterplots">Scatterplots</h3>
<p>The <code>tidyverse</code> package has extremely powerful and
flexible tools for making statistical graphics. We can create a simple
plot of the number of girls baptized per year with the following
command.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">ggplot</span>(arbuthnot, <span class="fu">aes</span>(<span class="at">x =</span> year, <span class="at">y =</span> girls)) <span class="sc">+</span> <span class="fu">geom_point</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The first <code>ggplot(...)</code> part of this command tells R to
look inside the <code>arbuthnot</code> tibble, to use the
<code>year</code> column of that tibble for the x-axis of the graphic,
the <code>girls</code> column for the y-axis. The
<code>+ geom_point()</code> part of this command tells R to make points
corresponding to this data. To connect these points with lines, we can
add <code>+ geom_line()</code> to the command as follows:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb10"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb10-1"><a href="#cb10-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">ggplot</span>(arbuthnot, <span class="fu">aes</span>(year, girls)) <span class="sc">+</span> <span class="fu">geom_point</span>() <span class="sc">+</span> <span class="fu">geom_line</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This time, note that we left out the <code>x =</code> and
<code>y =</code> inside the <code>aes(...)</code>. This is because
<code>aes</code> automatically understands its first argument to be the
x-axis variable and the second argument to be the y-axis variable.</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Is there an apparent trend in the number of girls baptized over the
years? How would you describe it?</p>
</div>
<p>The syntax for these <code>ggplot</code> commands might look a little
confusing, because it is: it is based on a rich grammar of graphics that
you can read extensively about in <a
href="https://ggplot2-book.org/">this book</a>. For the purposes of
these labs, we’ll just need some basic types of plots. Most of the time,
the code for making plots will be given to you explicitly (like above).
Sometimes, you might need to slightly tweak some code that’s given to
you to get the plot you need.</p>
<h3 id="manipulating-data">Manipulating Data</h3>
<p>R can be used as a calculator. If you wanted to know the total number
of baptisms in 1629, you could just see that there were 5218 boy
baptisms and 4683 girl baptisms, and then we could add these numbers
together by typing</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb11"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb11-1"><a href="#cb11-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="dv">5218</span> <span class="sc">+</span> <span class="dv">4683</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>into the console to see the total number of baptisms in 1629.</p>
<p>What if we wanted to know the total number of baptisms for every
year? We could repeat the above process once for each year, but that
would require us to type 82 different additions into the console! There
are much faster ways.</p>
<p>One strategy is to add together the vectors that record numbers of
baptisms for boys and girls. R will compute all sums simultaneously:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb12"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb12-1"><a href="#cb12-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>arbuthnot<span class="sc">$</span>boys <span class="sc">+</span> arbuthnot<span class="sc">$</span>girls</span></code></pre></div>
<p>What you will see are 82 numbers (in that packed display, because we
aren’t looking at a tibble here), each one representing the sum we’re
after. Take a look at a few of them and verify that they are right.</p>
<p>Another strategy is to add a column to our <code>arbuthnot</code>
tibble that records these totals. Here’s one way of doing this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb13"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb13-1"><a href="#cb13-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>arbuthnot <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">mutate</span>(arbuthnot, <span class="at">total =</span> boys <span class="sc">+</span> girls)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>mutate(...)</code> part above tells R to construct a new
tibble that has all of the same columns as the <code>arbuthnot</code>
tibble and also has a new column called <code>total</code>, which is the
sum of the <code>boys</code> and <code>girls</code> columns of the
original tibble. The <code>arbuthnot &lt;-</code> part of the command
tells R to store this new tibble back into <code>arbuthnot</code>,
effectively replacing our original tibble.</p>
<p>We can now make a plot of total number of baptisms per year:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb14"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb14-1"><a href="#cb14-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">ggplot</span>(arbuthnot, <span class="fu">aes</span>(year, total)) <span class="sc">+</span> <span class="fu">geom_point</span>() <span class="sc">+</span> <span class="fu">geom_line</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Similarly to how we computed the proportion of boys, we can compute
the ratio of the number of boys to the number of girls baptized in 1629
with</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb15"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb15-1"><a href="#cb15-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="dv">5218</span> <span class="sc">/</span> <span class="dv">4683</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>or we can act on the complete vectors with the expression</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb16"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb16-1"><a href="#cb16-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>arbuthnot<span class="sc">$</span>boys <span class="sc">/</span> arbuthnot<span class="sc">$</span>girls</span></code></pre></div>
<p>or we can add a new column to our tibble:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb17"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb17-1"><a href="#cb17-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>arbuthnot <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">mutate</span>(arbuthnot, <span class="at">ratio =</span> boys <span class="sc">/</span> girls)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can now make a plot of the boy-to-girl ratio over time using:</p>
<pre><code>ggplot(arbuthnot, aes(year, ratio)) + geom_point() + geom_line()</code></pre>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Use <code>mutate</code> to add a column called <code>prop_boy</code>
to the <code>arbuthnot</code> tibble that records the proportion of the
total number of newborns that were boys. Then make a plot of the
proportion of boys over time. What do you see?</p>
<p>Tip: If you use the up and down arrow keys, you can scroll through
your previous commands, your so-called <em>command history</em>. You can
also access it by clicking on the history tab in the upper right panel.
This will save you a lot of typing in the future.</p>
</div>
<p>Finally, in addition to simple mathematical operators like
subtraction and division, you can ask R to make comparisons like greater
than <code>&gt;</code>, less than <code>&lt;</code>, and equality
<code>==</code>. For example, we can ask if boys outnumber girls in each
year with the expression</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb19"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb19-1"><a href="#cb19-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>arbuthnot<span class="sc">$</span>boys <span class="sc">&gt;</span> arbuthnot<span class="sc">$</span>girls</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This command returns 82 values of either <code>TRUE</code> if that
year had more boys than girls, or <code>FALSE</code> if that year did
not (the output from the above command may surprise you!). This output
shows a different kind of data than we have considered so far. In the
<code>arbuthnot</code> tibble our values are numerical (the year, the
number of boys and girls). Here, we’ve asked R to create logical data,
ie, data where the values are either <code>TRUE</code> or
<code>FALSE</code>.</p>
<p>In general, data analysis will involve many different kinds of data
types, and one reason for using R is that it is able to represent and
compute with many of them.</p>
<h3 id="another-data-set">Another Data Set</h3>
<p>The next few exercises involve repeating some of the above steps but
for present-day birth records in the United States. These data come from
<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr53/nvsr53_20.pdf">a
report by the Centers for Disease Control</a>. Check it out if you would
like to read more about an analysis of sex ratios at birth in the United
States.</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Load up the data in file <a
href="https://sagrawalx.github.io/teaching/data/present.csv"><code>https://sagrawalx.github.io/teaching/data/present.csv</code></a>
using <code>read_csv</code> and store it in a variable called
<code>present</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>What years are included in this data set? What are the dimensions of
the data frame and what are the variable or column names?</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>How do the birth counts compare to Arbuthnot’s? Are they on a similar
scale?</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Add a column to the <code>present</code> tibble called
<code>ratio</code> which records the boy-to-girl ratio. Then make a plot
that displays the boy-to-girl ratio for every year. What do you see?</p>
<p>Note: You may be surprised by the result, especially if you’re aware
of issues involving sex-selective abortion in some developing countries.
You may find it useful to look through <a
href="https://ourworldindata.org/gender-ratio">this article</a> if you
find yourself puzzled.</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>In what year did we see the most total number of births in the
US?</p>
<p>Hint: First add a column to <code>present</code> called
<code>total</code> that records the total number of births. Then run
<code>slice_max(present, total)</code> to see the “slice” (ie, the row)
of the tibble which contains the maximum value under
<code>total</code>.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="two">Introduction to Data</h2>
<p>In this lab, you will gain insight into public health by generating
simple graphical and numerical summaries of a data set collected by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). As this is a large
data set, along the way you’ll also learn the indispensable skills of
data processing and subsetting.</p>
<h3 id="behavioral-risk-factor-surveillance-system">Behavioral Risk
Factor Surveillance System</h3>
<p>The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is an annual
telephone survey of 350,000 people in the United States. As its name
implies, the BRFSS is designed to identify risk factors in the adult
population and report emerging health trends. For example, respondents
are asked about their diet and weekly physical activity, their HIV/AIDS
status, possible tobacco use, and even their level of healthcare
coverage. The <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/brfss">BRFSS website</a>
contains a complete description of the survey, including the research
questions that motivate the study and many interesting results derived
from the data.</p>
<p>We will focus on a random sample of 20,000 people from the BRFSS
survey conducted in 2000. While there are over 200 variables in this
data set, we will work with a small subset. Load the data set from the
<code>csv</code> file at <a
href="https://sagrawalx.github.io/teaching/data/cdc.csv"><code>https://sagrawalx.github.io/teaching/data/cdc.csv</code></a>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb20"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb20-1"><a href="#cb20-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>cdc <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">read_csv</span>(<span class="st">&quot;https://sagrawalx.github.io/teaching/data/cdc.csv&quot;</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Like in lab 1, you can now type <code>cdc</code> into the console to
see the first 10 rows of the data. Each row in this tibble represents an
observation, ie, a survey respondent. The variables (ie, column names)
correspond to questions that were asked in the survey. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>For <code>genhlth</code>, respondents were asked to evaluate their
general health, responding either <code>excellent</code>,
<code>very good</code>, <code>good</code>, <code>fair</code> or
<code>poor</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>exerany</code> variable indicates whether the respondent
exercised in the past month (<code>1</code>) or did not
(<code>0</code>).</li>
<li><code>hlthplan</code> indicates whether the respondent had some form
of health coverage (<code>1</code>) or did not (<code>0</code>).</li>
<li>The <code>smoke100</code> variable indicates whether the respondent
had smoked at least 100 cigarettes in her lifetime.</li>
</ul>
<p>The other variables record the respondent’s <code>height</code> in
inches, <code>weight</code> in pounds as well as their desired weight
<code>wtdesire</code>, <code>age</code> in years, and
<code>gender</code>.</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>How many observations are there in this data set? How many variables?
Determine whether each variable is categorical or numerical. Be careful:
some of the variables have entries recorded as numbers, but they aren’t
actually numerical variables.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="summaries-and-tables">Summaries and Tables</h3>
<p>The BRFSS questionnaire is a massive trove of information. A good
first step in any analysis is to distill all of that information into a
few summary statistics and graphics.</p>
<p>As a simple example, the function summary returns a numerical
summary: minimum, first quartile, median, mean, second quartile, and
maximum. For <code>weight</code>, this is computed as follows:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb21"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb21-1"><a href="#cb21-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">summary</span>(cdc<span class="sc">$</span>weight)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>R also has built-in functions to compute summary statistics one by
one. For instance, to calculate the mean, median, and variance of

<p>While it makes sense to describe a quantitative variable like weight
in terms of these statistics, what about categorical data? We would
instead consider the sample frequency or relative frequency
distribution. For example, suppose we want to see the number of people
who have smoked 100 cigarettes in their lifetime. You could type the
following into the console:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb23"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb23-1"><a href="#cb23-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">count</span>(cdc, smoke100)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can also make a bar plot as follows:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb24"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb24-1"><a href="#cb24-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">ggplot</span>(cdc, <span class="fu">aes</span>(smoke100)) <span class="sc">+</span> <span class="fu">geom_bar</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Create a numerical summary for <code>height</code> and
<code>age</code>, and compute the interquartile range for each. How many
males are in the sample? What proportion of the sample reports being in
excellent health?</p>
</div>
<p>The <code>count</code> command can be used to tabulate any number of
variables that you provide. For example, to examine which participants
have smoked across each <code>gender</code>, we could use the
following.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb25"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb25-1"><a href="#cb25-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">count</span>(cdc, gender, smoke100)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Finally, to make side-by-side bar plots to visualize
<code>smoke100</code> and <code>gender</code>, we can do the
following:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb26"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb26-1"><a href="#cb26-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">ggplot</span>(cdc, <span class="fu">aes</span>(<span class="fu">factor</span>(smoke100), <span class="at">fill =</span> gender)) <span class="sc">+</span> <span class="fu">geom_bar</span>(<span class="at">position =</span> <span class="st">&quot;dodge&quot;</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>What does the side-by-side bar plot reveal about smoking habits and

<h3 id="interlude-how-r-thinks-about-data">Interlude: How R Thinks About
Data</h3>
<p>As we’ve seen, tibbles are kind of like spreadsheets where each row
is a different observation (in this case, a different respondent) and
each column is a different variable (<code>genhlth</code>,
<code>exerany</code>, and so on). We can extract a list of the entries
in a particular column using <code>$</code>, as follows:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb27"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb27-1"><a href="#cb27-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>cdc<span class="sc">$</span>genhlth</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This will spit out a list of 20,000 strings telling us about the
general health of the survey respondents. To extract the 345th entry in
this list, we can do this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb28"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb28-1"><a href="#cb28-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>cdc<span class="sc">$</span>genhlth[<span class="dv">345</span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This tells me that the 345th survey respondent reported having
“excellent” health. To extract the general health of the 400th through
410th respondents, we can do this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb29"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb29-1"><a href="#cb29-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>cdc<span class="sc">$</span>genhlth[<span class="dv">400</span><span class="sc">:</span><span class="dv">410</span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The syntax <code>400:410</code> generates a list of numbers from 400
to 410, and then putting those in brackets next to the list name tells R
to access the entries in the 400th through 410th positions in the
list.</p>
<p>To extract a single row of the tibble, use the <code>slice</code>
function. For example, this will return the 17th row of the data.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb30"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb30-1"><a href="#cb30-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">slice</span>(cdc, <span class="dv">17</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>To extract the 100th through 107th rows of the data, we can do
this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb31"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb31-1"><a href="#cb31-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">slice</span>(cdc, <span class="dv">100</span><span class="sc">:</span><span class="dv">107</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="a-little-more-on-subsetting">A little more on subsetting</h3>
<p>It’s often useful to extract all individuals (cases) in a data set
that have specific characteristics. We accomplish this through filters.
First, consider expressions like</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb32"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb32-1"><a href="#cb32-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>cdc<span class="sc">$</span>gender <span class="sc">==</span> <span class="st">&quot;m&quot;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>or</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb33"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb33-1"><a href="#cb33-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>cdc<span class="sc">$</span>age <span class="sc">&gt;</span> <span class="dv">30</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>These commands produce a series of <code>TRUE</code> and
<code>FALSE</code> values. There is one value for each respondent, where
TRUE indicates that the person was male (via the first command) or older
than 30 (second command).</p>
<p>Suppose we want to extract just the data for the men in the sample,
or just for those over 30. We can use the R function <code>subset</code>
to do that for us. For example, the command</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb34"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb34-1"><a href="#cb34-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>mdata <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">filter</span>(cdc, gender <span class="sc">==</span> <span class="st">&quot;m&quot;</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>will create a new data set called <code>mdata</code> that contains
only the men from the <code>cdc</code> data set. In addition to finding
it in your workspace alongside its dimensions, you can take a peek at
the first several rows as usual:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb35"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb35-1"><a href="#cb35-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>mdata</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This new data set contains all the same variables but just under half
the rows. It is also possible to tell R to keep only specific variables,
which is a topic we’ll discuss in a future lab. For now, the important
thing is that we can carve up the data based on values of one or more
variables.</p>
<p>As an aside, you can use several of these conditions together with
<code>&amp;</code> and <code>|</code>. The <code>&amp;</code> is read
“and” so that</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb36"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb36-1"><a href="#cb36-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">filter</span>(cdc, gender <span class="sc">==</span> <span class="st">&quot;m&quot;</span> <span class="sc">&amp;</span> age <span class="sc">&gt;</span> <span class="dv">30</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>will give you the data for men over the age of 30. The <code>|</code>
character is read “or” so that</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb37"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb37-1"><a href="#cb37-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">filter</span>(cdc, gender <span class="sc">==</span> <span class="st">&quot;m&quot;</span> <span class="sc">|</span> age <span class="sc">&gt;</span> <span class="dv">30</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>will take people who are men or over the age of 30 or both (why
that’s an interesting group is hard to say, but right now the mechanics
of this are the important thing). In principle, you may use as many
“and” and “or” clauses as you like when forming a subset.</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Create a new object called <code>under23_and_smoke</code> that
contains all observations of respondents under the age of 23 that have
smoked 100 cigarettes in their lifetime. Write the command you used to
create the new object as the answer to this exercise.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="quantitative-data">Quantitative data</h3>
<p>With our subsetting tools in hand, we’ll now return to the task of
the day: making basic summaries of the BRFSS questionnaire. We’ve
already looked at categorical data such as smoke and gender so now let’s
turn our attention to quantitative data. Two common ways to visualize
quantitative data are with box plots and histograms. We can construct a
box plot for a single variable with the following command.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb38"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb38-1"><a href="#cb38-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">ggplot</span>(cdc, <span class="fu">aes</span>(<span class="at">y =</span> height)) <span class="sc">+</span> <span class="fu">geom_boxplot</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can compare the locations of the components of the box by
examining the summary statistics.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb39"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb39-1"><a href="#cb39-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">summary</span>(cdc<span class="sc">$</span>height)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Confirm that the median and upper and lower quartiles reported in the
numerical summary match those in the graph. The purpose of a boxplot is
to provide a thumbnail sketch of a variable for the purpose of comparing
across several categories. So we can, for example, compare the heights
of men and women with:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb40"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb40-1"><a href="#cb40-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">ggplot</span>(cdc, <span class="fu">aes</span>(<span class="at">x =</span> gender, <span class="at">y =</span> height)) <span class="sc">+</span> <span class="fu">geom_boxplot</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Next let’s consider a new variable that doesn’t show up directly in
this data set: <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index">Body Mass Index
(BMI)</a>. BMI is a weight to height ratio and can be calculated as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \text{BMI} = 703 \cdot
\frac{\text{weight in lbs}}{(\text{height in ins})^2}. \]</span></p>
<p>Note: The 703 is the approximate conversion factor to change units
from metric (meters and kilograms) to US customary (inches and
pounds).</p>
<p>Let’s now add a <code>bmi</code> column to our <code>cdc</code>
tibble and then make box plots of <code>bmi</code> for each possible
value of <code>genhlth</code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb41"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb41-1"><a href="#cb41-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>cdc <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">mutate</span>(cdc, <span class="at">bmi =</span> <span class="dv">703</span> <span class="sc">*</span> (weight <span class="sc">/</span> height<span class="sc">^</span><span class="dv">2</span>))</span>
<span id="cb41-2"><a href="#cb41-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">ggplot</span>(cdc, <span class="fu">aes</span>(<span class="fu">factor</span>(genhlth), bmi)) <span class="sc">+</span> <span class="fu">geom_boxplot</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>What does this box plot show? Pick another categorical variable from
the data set and see how it relates to BMI. List the variable you chose,
why you might think it would have a relationship to BMI, and indicate
what the figure seems to suggest.</p>
</div>
<p>Finally, let’s make some histograms. We can look at the histogram for
the age of our respondents with the command</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb42"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb42-1"><a href="#cb42-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">ggplot</span>(cdc, <span class="fu">aes</span>(age)) <span class="sc">+</span> <span class="fu">geom_histogram</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Histograms are a decent way to see the shape of a single
distribution, but that shape can change depending on how the data is
split between the different bins. You can control the width of bins
using the <code>binwidth</code> argument:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb43"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb43-1"><a href="#cb43-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">ggplot</span>(cdc, <span class="fu">aes</span>(age)) <span class="sc">+</span> <span class="fu">geom_histogram</span>(<span class="at">binwidth =</span> <span class="dv">2</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Note that you can flip between plots that you’ve created by clicking
the forward and backward arrows in the lower right region of RStudio,
just above the plots.</p>
<p>At this point, we’ve done a good first pass at analyzing the
information in the BRFSS questionnaire. We’ve found an interesting
association between smoking and gender, and we can say something about
the relationship between people’s assessment of their general health and
their own BMI. We’ve also picked up essential computing tools — summary
statistics, subsetting, and plots — that will serve us well throughout
this course.</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Make a scatterplot of weight versus desired weight. (You’ll just want
<code>geom_point</code> for this scatterplot and no
<code>geom_line</code>!) Describe the relationship between these two
variables.</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Create a new variable in the <code>cdc</code> tibble called
<code>wtlossdesire</code> which represents the amount of weight that
each survey respondent wants to lose. If a person’s
<code>wtlossdesire</code> is 0, what does this mean about the person’s
weight and desired weight? What if <code>wtlossdesire</code> is
positive? Negative?</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Describe the distribution of <code>wtlossdesire</code> in terms of
its center, shape, and spread, including any plots you use. What does
this tell us about how people feel about their current weight?</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Using numerical summaries and a side-by-side box plot, determine if
men tend to view their weight differently than women.</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Now it’s time to get creative. Find the mean and standard deviation
of weight, and then determine what proportion of the weights are within
one standard deviation of the mean.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="three">Probability</h2>
<h3 id="hot-hands">Hot Hands</h3>
<p>Basketball players who make several baskets in succession are
described as having a <em>hot hand</em>. Fans and players have long
believed in the hot hand phenomenon, which refutes the assumption that
each shot is independent of the next. However, a 1985 paper by Gilovich,
Vallone, and Tversky collected evidence that contradicted this belief
and showed that successive shots are independent events (cf. <a
href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0010-0285(85)90010-6">doi:10.1016/0010-0285(85)90010-6</a>).
This paper started a great controversy that continues to this day, as
you can see by googling hot hand basketball.</p>
<p>We do not expect to resolve this controversy today. However, in this
lab we’ll apply one approach to answering questions like this. The goals
for this lab are to (1) think about the effects of independent and
dependent events, (2) learn how to simulate shooting streaks in R, and
(3) to compare a simulation to actual data in order to determine if the
hot hand phenomenon appears to be real.</p>
<h3 id="saving-your-code">Saving Your Code</h3>
<p>Click on File -&gt; New -&gt; R Script. This will open a blank
document above the console. As you go along you can copy and paste your
code here and save it. This is a good way to keep track of your code and
be able to reuse it later. To run your code from this document you can
copy and paste it into the console. Alternatively, you can highlight the
code and either hit Cmd+Enter (Mac) or Ctrl+Enter (Windows/Linux).</p>
<p>You’ll also want to save this script (code document). To do so click
on the disk icon. The first time you hit save, RStudio will ask for a
file name; you can name it anything you like. Once you hit save you’ll
see the file appear under the Files tab in the lower right panel. You
can reopen this file anytime by simply clicking on it.</p>
<h3 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h3>
<p>Our investigation will focus on the performance of one player: Kobe
Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers. His performance against the Orlando
Magic in the 2009 NBA finals earned him the title Most Valuable Player
and many spectators commented on how he appeared to show a hot hand.
Let’s load some data from those games and look at the first several
rows.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb44"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb44-1"><a href="#cb44-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>kobe <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">read_csv</span>(<span class="st">&quot;https://sagrawalx.github.io/teaching/data/kobe.csv&quot;</span>)</span>
<span id="cb44-2"><a href="#cb44-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>kobe</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In this data frame, every row records a shot taken by Kobe Bryant. If
he hit the shot (made a basket), a hit <code>H</code> is recorded in the
column named <code>basket</code>; otherwise a miss <code>M</code> is
recorded.</p>
<p>Just looking at the string of hits and misses, it can be difficult to
gauge whether or not it seems like Kobe was shooting with a hot hand.
One way we can approach this is by considering the belief that hot hand
shooters tend to go on shooting streaks. For this lab, we define the
length of a shooting streak to be the number of consecutive baskets made
until a miss occurs.</p>
<p>For example, in Game 1 Kobe had the following sequence of hits and
misses from his nine shot attempts in the first quarter:</p>
<p>H M | M | H H M | M | M | M</p>
<p>To verify this use the following command:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb45"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb45-1"><a href="#cb45-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>kobe<span class="sc">$</span>basket[<span class="dv">1</span><span class="sc">:</span><span class="dv">9</span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Within the nine shot attempts, there are six streaks, which are
separated by a “|” above. Their lengths are one, zero, two, zero, zero,
zero (in order of occurrence).</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>What does a streak length of 1 mean, ie, how many hits and misses are
in a streak of 1? What about a streak length of 0?</p>
</div>
<p>Let’s now define a function, <code>streak_lengths</code>, which will
go take as input a sequence of <code>H</code>s and <code>M</code>s (like
<code>kobe$basket</code>). It’ll then output a list of all of the streak
lengths. Copy the following into the console. You don’t need to
understand how this works, but if you’re interested in programming,
you’ll probably enjoy trying to puzzle out what’s going on here.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb46"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb46-1"><a href="#cb46-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>streak_lengths <span class="ot">=</span> <span class="cf">function</span>(seq) {</span>

<span id="cb46-4"><a href="#cb46-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  misses <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">which</span>(booleanized)</span>

<span id="cb46-6"><a href="#cb46-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now that this function is defined, we can use it any time we want.
Let’s use it to calculate all of Kobe’s streak lengths and make a bar
plot.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb47"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb47-1"><a href="#cb47-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>kobe_streaks <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">streak_lengths</span>(kobe<span class="sc">$</span>basket)</span>

<p>Note we choose to make a bar plot (rather than a histogram) here
because our variable is discrete (rather than continuous).</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Describe the distribution of Kobe’s streak lengths from the 2009 NBA
finals. What was his typical streak length? How long was his longest
streak of baskets?</p>
</div>
<h3 id="compared-to-what">Compared to what?</h3>
<p>We’ve shown that Kobe had some long shooting streaks, but are they
long enough to support the belief that he had hot hands? What can we
compare them to?</p>
<p>To answer these questions, let’s return to the idea of independence.
Two processes are independent if the outcome of one process doesn’t
effect the outcome of the second. If each shot that a player takes is an
independent process, having made or missed your first shot will not
affect the probability that you will make or miss your second shot.</p>
<p>A shooter with a hot hand will have shots that are not independent of
one another. Specifically, if the shooter makes his first shot, the hot
hand model says he will have a higher probability of making his second
shot.</p>
<p>Let’s suppose for a moment that the hot hand model is valid for Kobe.
During his career, the percentage of time Kobe makes a basket (i.e. his
shooting percentage) is about 45%, or in probability notation,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ P(\text{shot 1} = \text{H})=0.45
\]</span></p>
<p>If he makes the first shot and has a hot hand (not independent
shots), then the probability that he makes his second shot would go up
to, let’s say, 60%,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ P(\text{shot 2} = \text{H} \mid
\text{shot 1} = \text{H})=0.60 \]</span></p>
<p>As a result of these increased probabilites, you’d expect Kobe to
have longer streaks. Compare this to the skeptical perspective where
Kobe does not have a hot hand, where each shot is independent of the
next. If he hit his first shot, the probability that he makes the second
is still 0.45.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ P(\text{shot 2} = \text{H}
\mid  \text{shot 1} = \text{H})=0.45 \]</span></p>
<p>In other words, making the first shot did nothing to effect the
probability that he’d make his second shot. If Kobe’s shots are
independent, then he’d have the same probability of hitting every shot
regardless of his past shots: 45%.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve phrased the situation in terms of independent shots,
let’s return to the question: how do we tell if Kobe’s shooting streaks
are long enough to indicate that he has hot hands? We can compare his
streak lengths to someone without hot hands: an independent shooter.</p>
<h3 id="simulations-in-r">Simulations in R</h3>
<p>While we don’t have any data from a shooter we know to have
independent shots, that sort of data is very easy to simulate in R. In a
simulation, you set the ground rules of a random process and then the
computer uses random numbers to generate an outcome that adheres to
those rules. As a simple example, you can simulate flipping a fair coin
with the following.</p>

<p>The vector outcomes can be thought of as a hat with two slips of
paper in it: one slip says <code>heads</code> and the other says
<code>tails</code>. The function sample draws one slip from the hat and
tells us if it was a head or a tail.</p>
<p>Run the second command listed above several times. Just like when
flipping a coin, sometimes you’ll get a <code>heads</code>, sometimes
you’ll get a <code>tails</code>, but in the long run, you’d expect to
get roughly equal numbers of each.</p>
<p>If you wanted to simulate flipping a fair coin 100 times, you could
either run the function 100 times or, more simply, adjust the
<code>size</code> argument, which governs how many samples to draw (the
<code>replace = TRUE</code> argument indicates we put the slip of paper
back in the hat before drawing again). Save the resulting vector of
heads and tails in a new object called <code>sim_fair_coin</code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb49"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb49-1"><a href="#cb49-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>sim_fair_coin <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">sample</span>(outcomes, <span class="at">size =</span> <span class="dv">100</span>, <span class="at">replace =</span> <span class="cn">TRUE</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>To view the results of this simulation, type the name of the object
and then use <code>fct_count</code> to count up the number of heads and
tails:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb50"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb50-1"><a href="#cb50-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>sim_fair_coin</span>
<span id="cb50-2"><a href="#cb50-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">fct_count</span>(sim_fair_coin)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Since there are only two elements in outcomes, the probability that
we “flip” a coin and it lands heads is 0.5. Say we’re trying to simulate
an unfair coin that we know only lands heads 20% of the time. We can
adjust for this by adding an argument called prob, which provides a
vector of two probability weights.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb51"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb51-1"><a href="#cb51-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>sim_unfair_coin <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">sample</span>(outcomes, <span class="at">size =</span> <span class="dv">100</span>, <span class="at">replace =</span> <span class="cn">TRUE</span>, <span class="at">prob =</span> <span class="fu">c</span>(<span class="fl">0.2</span>, <span class="fl">0.8</span>))</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>prob = c(0.2, 0.8)</code> indicates that for the two
elements in the <code>outcomes</code> vector, we want to select the
first one, <code>heads</code>, with probability 0.2 and the second one,
<code>tails</code>, with probability 0.8. Another way of thinking about
this is to think of the outcome space as a bag of 10 chips, where 2
chips are labeled “head” and 8 chips “tail”. Therefore at each draw, the
probability of drawing a chip that says “head”” is 20%, and “tail” is
80%.</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>In your simulation of flipping the unfair coin 100 times, how many
flips came up heads?</p>
</div>
<p>In a sense, we’ve shrunken the size of the slip of paper that says
“heads”, making it less likely to be drawn and we’ve increased the size
of the slip of paper saying “tails”, making it more likely to be drawn.
When we simulated the fair coin, both slips of paper were the same size.
This happens by default if you don’t provide a prob argument; all
elements in the outcomes vector have an equal probability of being
drawn.</p>

<h2 id="four">Normal Distribution</h2>
<p>In this lab we’ll investigate the probability distribution that is
most central to statistics: the normal distribution. If we are confident
that our data are nearly normal, that opens the door to many powerful
statistical methods. Here we’ll use the graphical tools of R to assess
the normality of our data and also learn how to generate random numbers
from a normal distribution.</p>
<h3 id="the-data">The Data</h3>
<p>This week we’ll be working with measurements of body dimensions. This
data set contains measurements from 247 men and 260 women, most of whom
were considered healthy young adults.</p>
<p>Load the <code>csv</code> file located at <a
href="https://sagrawalx.github.io/teaching/data/bdims.csv"><code>https://sagrawalx.github.io/teaching/data/bdims.csv</code></a>
and then take a quick peek at the first few rows of the data.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb55"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb55-1"><a href="#cb55-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>bdims <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">read_csv</span>(<span class="st">&quot;https://sagrawalx.github.io/teaching/data/bdims.csv&quot;</span>)</span>

<p>This tibble has so many variables that the preview cannot show us all
of them. There are 25 measurements, many of which are either diameters
or girths. A key to the variable names can be found at <a
href="http://www.openintro.org/stat/data/bdims.php"
class="uri">http://www.openintro.org/stat/data/bdims.php</a>, but we’ll
be focusing on just three columns to get started: weight in kg
(<code>wgt</code>), height in cm (<code>hgt</code>), and
<code>sex</code> (<code>1</code> indicates male, <code>0</code>
indicates female).</p>
<p>Since males and females tend to have different body dimensions, it
will be useful to create two additional data sets: one with only men and
another with only women.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb56"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb56-1"><a href="#cb56-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>mdims <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">filter</span>(bdims, sex <span class="sc">==</span> <span class="dv">1</span>)</span>

<h3 id="the-normal-distribution">The Normal Distribution</h3>
<p>In your description of the distributions, did you use words like
bell-shaped or normal? It’s tempting to say so when faced with a
unimodal symmetric distribution.</p>
<p>To see how accurate that description is, we can plot a normal
distribution curve on top of a histogram to see how closely the data
follow a normal distribution. This normal curve should have the same
mean and standard deviation as the data. We’ll be working with women’s
heights, so let’s store them as a separate object and then calculate
some statistics that will be referenced later.</p>

<p>Next we make a density histogram to use as the backdrop and use
<code>stat_function</code> to overlay a normal probability curve. The
difference between a frequency histogram and a density histogram is that
while in a frequency histogram the heights of the bars add up to the
total number of observations, in a density histogram the areas of the
bars add up to 1. The area of each bar can be calculated as simply the
height times the width of the bar. Using a density histogram allows us
to properly overlay a normal distribution curve over the histogram since
the curve is a normal probability density function. Frequency and
density histograms both display the same exact shape; they only differ
in their y-axis. You can verify this by comparing the frequency
histogram you constructed earlier and the density histogram created by
the commands below.</p>

<h3 id="evaluating-the-normal-distribution">Evaluating the Normal
Distribution</h3>
<p>Eyeballing the shape of the histogram is one way to determine if the
data appear to be nearly normally distributed, but it can be frustrating
to decide just how close the histogram is to the curve. An alternative
approach involves constructing a normal Q-Q plot (where “Q-Q” stands for
“quantile-quantile”).</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb59"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb59-1"><a href="#cb59-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">ggplot</span>(fdims, <span class="fu">aes</span>(<span class="at">sample =</span> hgt)) <span class="sc">+</span> <span class="fu">geom_qq_line</span>() <span class="sc">+</span> <span class="fu">geom_qq</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<p>A data set that is nearly normal will result in a normal Q-Q plot
where the points closely follow the line. Any deviations from normality
leads to deviations of these points from the line. The plot for female
heights shows points that tend to follow the line but with some errant
points towards the tails. We’re left with the same problem that we
encountered with the histogram above: how close is close enough?</p>
<p>A useful way to address this question is to rephrase it as: what do
normal Q-Q plots look like for data that I know came from a normal
distribution? We can answer this by simulating data from a normal
distribution using rnorm.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb60"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb60-1"><a href="#cb60-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>sim_norm <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">rnorm</span>(<span class="at">n =</span> <span class="fu">length</span>(fdims<span class="sc">$</span>hgt), <span class="at">mean =</span> fhgtmean, <span class="at">sd =</span> fhgtsd)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The first argument indicates how many numbers you’d like to generate,
which we specify to be the same number of heights in the

last two arguments determine the mean and standard deviation of the
normal distribution from which the simulated sample will be generated.
We can take a look at the shape of our simulated data set,
<code>sim_norm</code>, as well as its normal Q-Q plot.</p>

<h3 id="normal-probabilities">Normal Probabilities</h3>
<p>Okay, so now you have a slew of tools to judge whether or not a
variable is normally distributed. Why should we care?</p>
<p>It turns out that statisticians know a lot about the normal
distribution. Once we decide that a random variable is approximately
normal, we can answer all sorts of questions about that variable related
to probability. Take, for example, the question of, “What is the
probability that a randomly chosen young adult female is taller than 6
feet (about 182 cm)?” (The study that published this data set is clear
to point out that the sample was not random and therefore inference to a
general population is not suggested. We do so here only as an
exercise.)</p>
<p>If we assume that female heights are normally distributed (a very
close approximation is also okay), we can find this probability by
calculating a Z score and consulting a Z table (also called a normal
probability table). In R, this is done in one step with the function
pnorm.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb64"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb64-1"><a href="#cb64-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="dv">1</span> <span class="sc">-</span> <span class="fu">pnorm</span>(<span class="at">q =</span> <span class="dv">182</span>, <span class="at">mean =</span> fhgtmean, <span class="at">sd =</span> fhgtsd)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Note that the function <code>pnorm</code> gives the area under the
normal curve below a given value, <code>q</code>, with a given mean and
standard deviation. Since we’re interested in the probability that
someone is taller than 182 cm, we have to take one minus that
probability.</p>
<p>Assuming a normal distribution has allowed us to calculate a
theoretical probability. If we want to calculate the probability
empirically, we simply need to determine how many observations fall
above 182 then divide this number by the total sample size.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb65"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb65-1"><a href="#cb65-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">sum</span>(fdims<span class="sc">$</span>hgt <span class="sc">&gt;</span> <span class="dv">182</span>) <span class="sc">/</span> <span class="fu">length</span>(fdims<span class="sc">$</span>hgt)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Although the probabilities are not exactly the same, they are
reasonably close. The closer that your distribution is to being normal,
the more accurate the theoretical probabilities will be.</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Write out two probability questions that you would like to answer;
one regarding female heights and one regarding female weights. Calculate
the those probabilities using both the theoretical normal distribution

Q-Q plots.</p>
<p>Note: Values have been standardized (subtract the mean and then

You will have to match shapes of the normal Q-Q plots to the shapes of
the corresponding histograms.</p>

<p>As you can see, normal probability plots can be used both to assess

skewed? Use a histogram to confirm your findings.</p>

<h2 id="five">Sampling Distributions</h2>
<p>In this lab, we investigate the ways in which the statistics from a

parameters. We’re interested in formulating a sampling distribution of

such as its distribution.</p>
<h3 id="the-data-1">The Data</h3>
<p>We consider real estate data from the city of Ames, Iowa. The details
of every real estate transaction in Ames is recorded by the City
Assessor’s office. Our particular focus for this lab will be all
residential home sales in Ames between 2006 and 2010. This collection
represents our population of interest. In this lab we would like to
learn about these home sales by taking smaller samples from the full
population. Let’s load the data.</p>

<p>We see that there are quite a few variables in the data set, enough
to do a very in-depth analysis. The above will throw some “parse
errors,” but don’t worry about this: for this lab, we’ll restrict our
attention to just two of the variables without any parse errors, namely,
the above ground living area of the house in square feet
(<code>Gr.Liv.Area</code>) and the sale price (<code>SalePrice</code>).
To save some effort throughout the lab, let’s reassign <code>ames</code>
to be the tibble which just has these two variables, and which
abbreviates their names to just <code>area</code> and
<code>price</code>:</p>

<h3 id="the-unknown-sampling-distribution">The Unknown Sampling
Distribution</h3>
<p>In this lab we have access to the entire population, but this is
rarely the case in real life. Gathering information on an entire
population is often extremely costly or impossible. Because of this, we
often take a sample of the population and use that to understand the
properties of the population.</p>
<p>If we were interested in estimating the mean living area in Ames
based on a sample, we can use the following command to survey the
population.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb69"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb69-1"><a href="#cb69-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>samp1 <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">slice_sample</span>(ames, <span class="at">n =</span> <span class="dv">50</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This command collects a simple random sample of size 50 from the
tibble <code>ames</code>, which is assigned to <code>samp1</code>. This
is like going into the City Assessor’s database and pulling up the files
on 50 random home sales. Working with these 50 files would be
considerably simpler than working with all 2930 home sales.</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Describe the distribution of the <code>area</code> variable in
<code>samp1</code>. How does it compare to the distribution of the
population?</p>
</div>
<p>If we’re interested in estimating the average living area in homes in
Ames using the sample, our best single guess is the sample mean.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb70"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb70-1"><a href="#cb70-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">mean</span>(samp1<span class="sc">$</span>area)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Depending on which 50 homes you selected, your estimate could be a
bit above or a bit below the true population mean of 1499.69 square
feet. In general, though, the sample mean turns out to be a pretty good
estimate of the average living area, and we were able to get it by
sampling less than 3% of the population.</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Take a second sample of size 50 and call it <code>samp2</code>. How
does the mean of <code>samp2</code> compare with the mean of
<code>samp1</code>? Suppose we took two more samples, one of size 100
and one of size 1000. Which would you think would provide a more
accurate estimate of the population mean?</p>
</div>
<p>Not surprisingly, every time we take another random sample, we get a
different sample mean. It’s useful to get a sense of just how much
variability we should expect when estimating the population mean this
way. The distribution of sample means, called the sampling distribution,
can help us understand this variability. In this lab, because we have
access to the population, we can build up the sampling distribution for
the sample mean by repeating the above steps many times. Here we will
generate 5000 samples and compute the sample mean of each.</p>

<p>Here we use R to take 5000 samples of size 50 from the population,
calculate the mean of each sample, and store each result in a tibble
called <code>samples</code>. This tibble has two columns, one named
<code>size</code> which records that the sample size was 50, and another
named <code>mean_area</code> which records the mean of the area of
houses in that sample. In the next section, we’ll review how this code
works.</p>

<h3 id="interlude-the-for-loop">Interlude: The <code>for</code>
Loop</h3>
<p>Let’s take a break from the statistics for a moment to let that last
block of code sink in. You have just run your first <code>for</code>
loop, a cornerstone of computer programming. The idea behind the
<code>for</code> loop is iteration: it allows you to execute code as
many times as you want without having to type out every iteration. In
the case above, we wanted to iterate the two lines of code inside the
curly braces that take a random sample of size 50 from area then save
the mean of that sample. Without the <code>for</code> loop, this would
be painful:</p>

<p>Let’s consider this code line by line to figure out what it does. In
the first line we initialized a tibble that will have two numeric
columns, one called <code>size</code> and one called
<code>mean_area</code>. This tibble is currently empty, but will
eventually store values generated within the <code>for</code> loop.</p>
<p>The second line calls the <code>for</code> loop itself. The syntax
can be loosely read as, “for every element <code>i</code> from 1 to
5000, run the following lines of code.” You can think of <code>i</code>
as the counter that keeps track of which loop you’re on. Therefore, more
precisely, the loop will run once when <code>i = 1</code>, then once
when <code>i = 2</code>, and so on, up to <code>i = 5000</code>.</p>
<p>The body of the <code>for</code> loop is the part inside the curly
braces, and this set of code is run for each value of <code>i</code>.
Here, on every loop, we take a random sample <code>samp</code> of size
50 from area. We then add a row to the <code>samples</code> tibble which
records the size of the sample (50) and the mean area of the sample
(which is what <code>mean(samp$area)</code> computes).</p>
<p>In order to display that this is really happening, we asked R to
print <code>i</code> at each iteration. This line of code is optional
and is only used for displaying what’s going on while the
<code>for</code> loop is running.</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>To make sure you understand what you’ve done in this loop, try
running a smaller version. Initialize a tibble called
<code>samples_small</code>. Run a loop that takes a sample of size 50
from area and stores the sample mean in <code>samples_small</code>, but
only iterate from 1 to 100. Print the output to your screen (type
<code>samples_small</code> into the console and press enter). How many
rows are there in <code>samples_small</code>? What does each row
represent?</p>
</div>
<h3 id="sample-size-and-the-sampling-distribution">Sample Size and the
Sampling Distribution</h3>
<p>Mechanics aside, let’s return to the reason we used a
<code>for</code> loop: to compute a sampling distribution, specifically,
this one.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb74"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb74-1"><a href="#cb74-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">ggplot</span>(samples, <span class="fu">aes</span>(mean_area)) <span class="sc">+</span> </span>

<p>The sampling distribution that we computed tells us much about
estimating the average living area in homes in Ames. Because the sample
mean is an unbiased estimator, the sampling distribution is centered at
the true average living area of the the population, and the spread of
the distribution indicates how much variability is induced by sampling
only 50 home sales.</p>
<p>To get a sense of the effect that sample size has on our
distribution, let’s build up two more sampling distributions: one based
on a sample size of 10 and another based on a sample size of 100.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb75"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb75-1"><a href="#cb75-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="cf">for</span>(i <span class="cf">in</span> <span class="dv">1</span><span class="sc">:</span><span class="dv">5000</span>) {</span>

<span id="cb75-6"><a href="#cb75-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Here we’re able to use a single for loop to build two distributions
by adding additional lines inside the curly braces. Note that the third
line inside the <code>for</code> loop reassigns <code>samp</code>: in
the first line it represents a sample of size 10, and in the third it
represents a sample of size 100. In general, anytime you create an
object using a name that is already in use, the old object will get
replaced with the new one.</p>
<p>To see the effect that different sample sizes have on the sampling
distribution, plot the three distributions on next to one another.</p>

<h2 id="six">Confidence Intervals for Categorical Data</h2>
<p>In August of 2012, news outlets ranging from the <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-faith/poll-shows-atheism-on-the-rise-in-the-us/2012/08/13/90020fd6-e57d-11e1-9739-eef99c5fb285_story.html">Washington
Post</a> to the <a
href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/atheism-rise-religiosity-decline-in-america_n_1777031">Huffington
Post</a> ran a story about the rise of atheism in America. The source
for the story was a poll that asked people, “Irrespective of whether you
attend a place of worship or not, would you say you are a religious
person, not a religious person or a convinced atheist?” This type of
question, which asks people to classify themselves in one way or
another, is common in polling and generates categorical data. In this
lab we take a look at the atheism survey and explore what’s at play when
making inference about population proportions using categorical
data.</p>
<h3 id="the-survey">The survey</h3>
<p>Here is the <a
href="https://github.com/OpenIntroStat/oilabs/raw/master/data-raw/atheism/Global_INDEX_of_Religiosity_and_Atheism_PR__6.pdf">press
release for the poll</a>, conducted by WIN-Gallup International. Take a
moment to review the report then address the following questions.</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>In the first paragraph, several key findings are reported. Do these
percentages appear to be sample statistics (derived from the data
sample) or population parameters?</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>The title of the report is “Global Index of Religiosity and Atheism.”
To generalize the report’s findings to the global human population, what
must we assume about the sampling method? Does that seem like a
reasonable assumption?</p>

<h3 id="the-data-2">The Data</h3>
<p>Turn your attention to Table 6 (pages 15 and 16), which reports the
sample size and response percentages for all 57 countries. While this is
a useful format to summarize the data, we will base our analysis on the
original data set of individual responses to the survey. Load this data
set into R with the following command.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb77"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb77-1"><a href="#cb77-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>atheism <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">read_csv</span>(<span class="st">&quot;https://sagrawalx.github.io/teaching/data/atheism.csv&quot;</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>What does each row of Table 6 correspond to? What does each row of
atheism correspond to?</p>
</div>
<p>To investigate the link between these two ways of organizing this
data, take a look at the estimated proportion of atheists in the United
States. Towards the bottom of Table 6, we see that this is 5%. We should
be able to come to the same number using the atheism data.</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Using a <code>filter</code>, create a new tibble called
<code>us12</code> that contains only the rows in atheism associated with
respondents to the 2012 survey from the United States. Then use
<code>count</code> to calculate the proportion of atheist responses in
<code>us12</code>. Does it agree with the percentage in Table 6? If not,
why?</p>
</div>
<h3 id="inference-on-proportions">Inference on Proportions</h3>
<p>Table 6 provides statistics, that is, calculations made from the
sample of 51,927 people. What we’d like, though, is insight into the
population parameters. You answer the question, “What proportion of
people in your sample reported being atheists?” with a statistic; while
the question “What proportion of people on earth would report being
atheists?” is answered with an estimate of the parameter.</p>
<p>There are two main inferential tools for estimating population
proportions: confidence intervals and hypothesis tests. In this lab,
we’ll focus on confidence intervals.</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Write out the conditions for inference to construct a 95% confidence
interval for the proportion of atheists in the United States in 2012.
Are you confident all conditions are met?</p>
</div>
<p>Here’s a function that calculates the confidence interval. Copy and
paste the following code into R. (Note that there’s an in-built function
called <code>prop.test</code> that does something similar, but it
computes a different confidence interval than the one we’ve learned in
class! So you should use the following function.)</p>

<p>This code defines a function, <code>proportion_ci</code>, which takes
as input a variable <code>x</code> which contains a list of boolean (ie,
<code>TRUE</code> or <code>FALSE</code>) values. It also takes an
optional argument, <code>conf_level</code>, to represent the confidence
level; this argument defaults to 0.95 if you don’t specify it.</p>
<p>Let’s now use this function to calculate a 95% confidence interval
for the proportion of atheists in the US in 2012:</p>

<p>What’s going on here? Remember that <code>us12</code> is a tibble,
one of whose columns is <code>response</code>. The values that
<code>response</code> can take are either <code>atheist</code> or
<code>non-atheist</code>. The command
<code>us12$response == "atheist"</code> goes through each entry of the
column <code>us12$response</code> and outputs <code>TRUE</code> if that
entry is <code>atheist</code> and <code>FALSE</code> otherwise. In other
words, the output of <code>us12$response == "atheist"</code> is a list
of boolean values. We can then feed that list of boolean values into the
<code>proportion_ci</code> function.</p>

<h3 id="how-proportion-affects-margin-of-error">How Proportion Affects
Margin of Error</h3>
<p>Imagine you’ve set out to survey 1000 people on two questions: are
you female? and are you left-handed? Since both of these sample
proportions were calculated from the same sample size, they should have
the same margin of error, right? Wrong! While the margin of error does
change with sample size, it is also affected by the proportion.</p>
<p>Think back to the formula for the standard error: $ =$. This is then
used in the formula for the margin of error for a 95% confidence
interval: <span class="math display">\[\mathrm{ME}=1.96\times
\mathrm{SE}=1.96×\sqrt{p(1−p)/n}.\]</span> Since the population
proportion <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is in this <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{ME}\)</span> formula, it should make sense
that the margin of error is in some way dependent on the population
proportion. We can visualize this relationship by creating a plot of
<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{ME}\)</span> vs. <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</p>

<h3 id="success-failure-condition">Success-failure condition</h3>
<p>The textbook emphasizes that you must always check conditions before
making inference. For inference on proportions, the sample proportion
can be assumed to be nearly normal if it is based upon a random sample
of independent observations and if both np≥10 and <span
class="math inline">\(n(1−p)\geq 10\)</span>. This rule of thumb is easy
enough to follow, but it makes one wonder: what’s so special about the
number 10?</p>
<p>The short answer is: nothing. You could argue that we would be fine
with 9 or that we really should be using 11. What is the “best” value
for such a rule of thumb is, at least to some degree, arbitrary.
However, when <span class="math inline">\(np\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(n(1−p)\)</span> reaches 10 the sampling
distribution is sufficiently normal to use confidence intervals and
hypothesis tests that are based on that approximation.</p>
<p>We can investigate the interplay between <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and the shape of the sampling
distribution by using simulations. To start off, we simulate the process
of drawing 5000 samples of size 1040 from a population with a true
atheist proportion of 0.1. For each of the 5000 samples we compute <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span> and then plot a histogram to
visualize their distribution.</p>

probabilities <code>p</code> and <code>1−p</code>, respectively.” The
second line in the loop says, “calculate the proportion of atheists in
this sample and record this value.” The loop allows us to repeat this
process 5000 times to build a good representation of the sampling

there in sizes of houses?”. If you have access to only a sample of the

<p>Return for a moment to the question that first motivated this lab:
based on this sample, what can we infer about the population? Based only
on this single sample, the best estimate of the average living area of
houses sold in Ames would be the sample mean, usually denoted as <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span> (here we’re calling it
<code>sample_mean</code>). That serves as a good point estimate but it
would be useful to also communicate how uncertain we are of that
estimate. This can be captured by using a confidence interval.</p>
<p>We can calculate a 95% confidence interval for a sample mean by
adding and subtracting 1.96 standard errors to the point estimate.</p>

## Inference for numerical data {#8}

### North Carolina births

In 2004, the state of North Carolina released a large data set containing information on births recorded in this state. This data set is useful to researchers studying the relation between habits and practices of expectant mothers and the birth of their children. We will work with a random sample of observations from this data set.

### Exploratory analysis

Load the nc data set into our workspace.

```R
nc <- read.csv("https://sagrawalx.github.io/teaching/data/nc.csv")
```

We have observations on 13 different variables, some categorical and some numerical. The meaning of each variable is as follows.

variable           description
-----------------  -------------------------
`fage`             father's age in years.
`mage`             mother's age in years.
`mature`           maturity status of mother.
`weeks`            length of pregnancy in weeks.
`premie`           whether the birth was classified as premature (`premie`) or full-term.
`visits`           number of hospital visits during `pregnancy
`marital`          whether mother is married or not married at birth
`gained`           weight gained by mother during pregnancy in pounds
`weight`           weight of the baby at birth in pounds
`lowbirthweight`   whether baby was classified as low birthweight (`low`) or not (`not low`).
`gender`           gender of the baby, `female` or `male`
`habit`            status of the mother as a `nonsmoker` or a `smoker`
`whitemom`         whether mom is `white` or `not white`



<div class="exercise">
What are the observations in this data frame? How many observations are there in our sample?
</div>

As a first step in the analysis, we should consider summaries of the data. This can be done using the summary command:

```R
summary(nc)
```

As you review the variable summaries, consider which variables are categorical and which are numerical. For numerical variables, are there outliers? If you aren't sure or want to take a closer look at the data, make a graph.

Consider the possible relationship between a mother's smoking habit and the weight of her baby. Plotting the data is a useful first step because it helps us quickly visualize trends, identify strong associations, and develop research questions.

<div class="exercise">
Make a side-by-side boxplot of `habit` and `weight`. What does the plot highlight about the relationship between these two variables?
</div>

The box plots show how the medians of the two distributions compare, but we can also compare the means of the distributions using the following function to split the weight variable into the habit groups, then take the mean of each using the mean function.

```R
by(nc$weight, nc$habit, mean)
```

There is an observed difference, but is this difference statistically significant? In order to answer this question we will conduct a hypothesis test.

<div class="exercise">
Check if the conditions necessary for inference are satisfied. Note that you will need to obtain sample sizes to check the conditions. You can compute the group size using the same by command above but replacing mean with length.
</div>

<div class="exercise">
Write the hypotheses for testing if the average weights of babies born to smoking and non-smoking mothers are different.
</div>

We'll now use the R function `t.test` to run a $t$-test for testing the hypothesis $H_0$ that $\mu_{\text{smoker}} - \mu_{\text{nonsmoker}} = 0$, where $\mu_{\text{smoker}}$ is the mean weight of babies born to smoking mothers and $\mu_{\text{nonsmoker}}$ is the mean weight of babies born to nonsmoking mothers. 

```R
t.test(nc$weight ~ nc$habit)
```



<div class="exercise">
What is the $p$-value of the $t$-test? What does this $p$-value mean? 

Note: I'm asking you to interpret the $p$-value as a probability (not to make a final conclusion about whether to reject or not reject $H_0$ based on the $p$-value). 
</div>

<div class="exercise">
What is a 95% confidence interval for $\mu_{\text{smoker}} - \mu_{\text{nonsmoker}}$? 

Note: Be careful about signs! The `t.test` function outputs a confidence interval for either $\mu_{\text{smoker}} - \mu_{\text{nonsmoker}}$ or $\mu_{\text{nonsmoker}} - \mu_{\text{smoker}}$. Which is it?
</div>

You can also use `t.test` for a single numerical variable. For example, `weeks` is the variable recording the length of the pregnancy. Run the following: 

```R
t.test(nc$weeks) 
```



<div class="exercise">
What is the 95% confidence interval for the average length of pregnancies? Interpret it in context.
</div>

<div class="exercise">
Calculate a new confidence interval for the same parameter at the 90% confidence level. You can change the confidence level by adding a new argument to the function: `conf.level = 0.90`.
</div>

<div class="exercise">
Conduct a hypothesis test evaluating whether the average weight gained by younger mothers is different than the average weight gained by mature mothers.
</div>

<div class="exercise">
Now, a non-inference task: Determine the age cutoff that was used in this study for younger and mature mothers. Use a method of your choice, and explain how your method works.
</div>

<div class="exercise">
Pick a pair of variables (one binary, one numerical) in this data set and come up with a research question evaluating the relationship between these variables. Formulate the question in a way that it can be answered using a hypothesis test and/or a confidence interval. Answer your question using the `t.test` function, report the statistical results, and also provide an explanation in plain language.
</div>

## Introduction to linear regression {#9}

### Batter up

The movie Moneyball focuses on the "quest for the secret of success in baseball." It follows a low-budget team, the Oakland Athletics, who believed that underused statistics, such as a player's ability to get on base, betterpredict the ability to score runs than typical statistics like home runs, RBIs (runs batted in), and batting average. Obtaining players who excelled in these underused statistics turned out to be much more affordable for the team.

In this lab we'll be looking at data from all 30 Major League Baseball teams and examining the linear relationship between runs scored in a season and a number of other player statistics. Our aim will be to summarize these relationships both graphically and numerically in order to find which variable, if any, helps us best predict a team's runs scored in a season.
The data

Let's load up the data for the 2011 season.

```R
mlb11 <- read.csv("https://sagrawalx.github.io/teaching/data/mlb11.csv")
```

In addition to `runs` scored, there are seven traditionally used variables in the data set: at-bats, hits, home runs, batting average, strikeouts, stolen bases, and wins. There are also three newer variables: on-base percentage, slugging percentage, and on-base plus slugging. For the first portion of the analysis we'll consider the seven traditional variables. At the end of the lab, you'll work with the newer variables on your own.

<div class="exercise">
What type of plot would you use to display the relationship between runs and one of the other numerical variables? Plot this relationship using the variable `at_bats` as the predictor. Does the relationship look linear? If you knew a team's `at_bats`, would you be comfortable using a linear model to predict the number of runs?
</div>

If the relationship looks linear, we can quantify the strength of the relationship with the correlation coefficient.

```R
cor(mlb11$runs, mlb11$at_bats)
```

Think back to the way that we described the distribution of a single variable. Recall that we discussed characteristics such as center, spread, and shape. It's also useful to be able to describe the relationship of two numerical variables, such as `runs` and `at_bats` above.

<div class="exercise">
Looking at your plot from the previous exercise, describe the relationship between these two variables. Make sure to discuss the form, direction, and strength of the relationship as well as any unusual observations.
</div>

### The linear model

We can use the `lm` function in R to fit the linear model (a.k.a. regression line).

```R
m1 <- lm(runs ~ at_bats, data = mlb11)
```

The first argument in the function lm is a formula that takes the form `y ~ x`. Here it can be read that we want to make a linear model of runs as a function of `at_bats`. The second argument specifies that R should look in the `mlb11` data frame to find the `runs` and `at_bats` variables.

The output of `lm` is an object that contains all of the information we need about the linear model that was just fit. We can access this information using the summary function.

```R
summary(m1)
```

Let's consider this output piece by piece. First, the formula used to describe the model is shown at the top. After the formula you find the five-number summary of the residuals. The "Coefficients" table shown next is key; its first column displays the linear model's y-intercept and the coefficient of at_bats. With this table, we can write down the least squares regression line for the linear model:

$$ \widehat{\mathrm{runs}} = −2789.2429 + 0.6305 \times \mathrm{at\_bats} $$

One last piece of information we will discuss from the summary output is the Multiple R-squared, or more simply, $R^2$. The $R^2$ value represents the proportion of variability in the response variable that is explained by the explanatory variable. For this model, 37.3% of the variability in runs is explained by at-bats.

<div class="exercise">
Fit a new model that uses `homeruns` to predict `runs`. Using the estimates from the R output, write the equation of the regression line. What does the slope tell us in the context of the relationship between success of a team and its home runs?
</div>

### Prediction and prediction errors

Let's create a scatterplot with the least squares line laid on top.

```R
plot(mlb11$runs ~ mlb11$at_bats)
abline(m1)
```

The function `abline` plots a line based on its slope and intercept. Here, we used a shortcut by providing the model `m1`, which contains both parameter estimates. This line can be used to predict $y$
at any value of $x$. When predictions are made for values of $x$ that are beyond the range of the observed data, it is referred to as extrapolation and is not usually recommended. However, predictions made within the range of the data are more reliable. They're also used to compute the residuals.

<div class="exercise">
If a team manager saw the least squares regression line and not the actual data, how many runs would he or she predict for a team with 5579 at-bats? Is this an overestimate or an underestimate, and by how much? In other words, what is the residual for this prediction?
</div>
  
### Model diagnostics

To assess whether the linear model is reliable, we need to check for (1) linearity, (2) nearly normal residuals, and (3) constant variability.

Linearity: You already checked if the relationship between runs and at-bats is linear using a scatterplot. We should also verify this condition with a plot of the residuals vs. at-bats. Recall that any code following a # is intended to be a comment that helps understand the code but is ignored by R.

```R
plot(m1$residuals ~ mlb11$at_bats)
abline(h = 0, lty = 3)  # adds a horizontal dashed line at y = 0
```

<div class="exercise">
Is there any apparent pattern in the residuals plot? What does this indicate about the linearity of the relationship between runs and at-bats?
</div>

Nearly normal residuals: To check this condition, we can look at a histogram

```R
hist(m1$residuals)
```

or a normal probability plot of the residuals.

```R
qqnorm(m1$residuals)
qqline(m1$residuals)  # adds diagonal line to the normal prob plot
```

<div class="exercise">
Based on the histogram and the normal probability plot, does the nearly normal residuals condition appear to be met?
</div>

Constant variability:

<div class="exercise">
Based on the plot in (1), does the constant variability condition appear to be met?
</div>

<div class="exercise">
Choose another traditional variable from `mlb11` that you think might be a good predictor of `runs`. Produce a scatterplot of the two variables and fit a linear model. At a glance, does there seem to be a linear relationship?
</div>

<div class="exercise">
How does this relationship compare to the relationship between runs and at_bats? Use the $R^2$ values from the two model summaries to compare. Does your variable seem to predict `runs` better than `at_bats`? How can you tell?
</div>

<div class="exercise">
Now that you can summarize the linear relationship between two variables, investigate the relationships between runs and each of the other five traditional variables. Which variable best predicts runs? Support your conclusion using the graphical and numerical methods we've discussed (for the sake of conciseness, only include output for the best variable, not all five).
</div>

<div class="exercise">
Now examine the three newer variables. These are the statistics used by the author of Moneyball to predict a teams success. In general, are they more or less effective at predicting runs that the old variables? Explain using appropriate graphical and numerical evidence. Of all ten variables we've analyzed, which seems to be the best predictor of runs? Using the limited (or not so limited) information you know about these baseball statistics, does your result make sense?
</div>

<div class="exercise">
Check the model diagnostics for the regression model with the variable you decided was the best predictor for runs.
