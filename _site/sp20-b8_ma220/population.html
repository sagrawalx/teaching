<h1 id="population-project">Population Project</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>This project asks you to explore a linear algebra model that is
sometimes used in population ecology. Write up your report, and submit
it as a PDF through Canvas. You’re strongly encouraged to discuss with
each other, but you should write up your report individually in your own
words.</p>
<p>You will need you to understand some matrix operations, and to know
how to do them on a computer. Specifically, the two operations you’ll
need to understand are matrix-vector products (look at Three.IV.2.3 in
the textbook) and matrix-matrix products (look at Three.IV.2.3 in the
textbook). The calculations involved below would be very tedious to do
by hand, but thankfully, there are many libraries out there to help you
do these calculations.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have a favorite programming language, I encourage you to
figure out how to do linear algebra calculations in that programming
language. Basically any programming language should be able to do the
kinds of calculations that are discussed below (R, Mathematica, …).</li>
<li>If you don’t have a favorite programming language, my suggestion is
to familiarize yourself with <a
href="https://www.sagemath.org/">SageMath</a>, an open source
mathematical programming language with fairly simple syntax (it builds
on top of Python). I’ve included some SageMath code snippets below to
help you. You can run SageMath through a browser at <a
href="https://cocalc.com/?utm_source=sagemath.org&amp;utm_medium=landingpage">CoCalc</a>,
but it’s painfully slow; if you can, I’d suggest following the
directions on the SageMath website to install it on your computer.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>We’re in charge of managing the population of a certain species of
fish in a certain lake. This species of fish has a life span of 4
years.</p>
<p>Every year, we run a census to find the number of fish of each age,
and record this number using a vector in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^{4}\)</span>. For example, a population
vector <span class="math inline">\(v = (100,90,80,70)\)</span> means
that there are 100 newborn fish, 90 1-year-old fish, 80 2-year-old fish,
and 70 3-year-old fish.</p>
<p>After collecting many years of data, we find that if the population
vector one year is <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>, then the
population vector the following year is given by the matrix-vector
product <span class="math inline">\(Av\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is the following <span
class="math inline">\(4 \times 4\)</span> matrix.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(A = \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 1.5 &amp; 4.2
&amp; 0 \\ 0.5 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0.6 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0.4 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}\)</span></p>
<p>Suppose that the lake was empty in the year 2000 and we introduced
100 newborn fish into the lake. Let <span
class="math inline">\(v_n\)</span> denote the population vector when
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> years have elapsed. In other
words, we have <span class="math inline">\(v_0 = (100, 0, 0, 0,
0)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(v_1 = Av_0\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(v_2 = Av_1 = A^2v_0\)</span>, and so forth. The
matrix <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is called the
<em>evolution matrix</em> of the system.</p>
<p>Here’s how you would put the evolution matrix <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and the population vector <span
class="math inline">\(v_0\)</span> into SageMath.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode py"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>A <span class="op">=</span> matrix([[<span class="dv">0</span>,<span class="fl">1.5</span>,<span class="fl">4.2</span>,<span class="dv">0</span>],[<span class="fl">.5</span>,<span class="dv">0</span>,<span class="dv">0</span>,<span class="dv">0</span>],[<span class="dv">0</span>,<span class="fl">.6</span>,<span class="dv">0</span>,<span class="dv">0</span>],[<span class="dv">0</span>,<span class="dv">0</span>,<span class="fl">.4</span>,<span class="dv">0</span>]])</span>

<p>Then, to calculate <span class="math inline">\(v_1 = Av_0\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(v_2 = A^2v_0\)</span>, you would type in
the following.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode py"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>A<span class="op">*</span>v</span>

<h2 id="part-1-basics">Part 1: Basics</h2>
<p>To answer the following questions, you might find it useful to
compute a few of the terms <span class="math inline">\(v_1, v_2, v_3,
...\)</span> by hand, to get some intuition about what the evolution
matrix is actually doing to the population vectors.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>These number in the first row of <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> are called <em>birth rates</em>.
Explain what these numbers mean.</p></li>
<li><p>The nonzero entries below the first row are called <em>survival
rates</em>. Explain what these numbers mean.</p></li>
<li><p>Calculate <span class="math inline">\(v_{10}, v_{100},
v_{1000}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(v_{10000}\)</span>.
Can you qualitatively describe what happens to the fish population over
time (eg, does it stay stable, does it blow up, …)?</p></li>
<li><p>Compare <span class="math inline">\(v_{100}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(v_{101}\)</span> by finding a real number <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(v_{101}\)</span> is <em>approximately</em> equal
to <span class="math inline">\(\lambda v_{100}\)</span>. Then do the
same to compare <span class="math inline">\(v_{1000}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(v_{1001}\)</span>. Then do the same to compare
<span class="math inline">\(v_{10000}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(v_{10001}\)</span>. What do you notice?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The number <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> that you
found above is called the <em>dominant eigenvalue</em> of the system.
We’ll discuss eigenvalues more at the end of the block.</p>
<h2 id="part-2-pollution">Part 2: Pollution</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Suppose that pollution in the lake causes all of the birth rates
to decline by 35% and survival rates to decline by 15%. Let <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> denote the new evolution matrix. How
does the evolution matrix change? Can you write <span
class="math inline">\(B = DA\)</span> for some matrix <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span>?</p></li>
<li><p>Calculate <span class="math inline">\(v_1, v_{10}, v_{100},
v_{1000}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v_{10000}\)</span>.
Qualitatively describe what happens to the fish population in the
long-term.</p></li>
<li><p>Finding the dominant eigenvalue of the system; in other words,
find a real number <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> such
that <span class="math inline">\(v_{10001}\)</span> is
<em>approximately</em> equal to <span class="math inline">\(\lambda
v_{10000}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose instead that pollution in the lake causes all of the
birth rates to decline by 36% instead, and survival coefficients still
decline by 15%. Qualitatively describe what happens to the fish
population in the long term now, and find the dominant eigenvalue of the
system.</p></li>
<li><p>Make a conjecture relating the dominant eigenvalue to the
qualitative long-term behavior of the fish population. You don’t need to
prove your conjecture; we’ll come back to this at the end of the
block.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="part-3-sustainable-harvesting">Part 3: Sustainable
Harvesting</h2>
<p>Let’s ignore pollution and return the original evolution matrix <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Suppose that a harvesting scheme is enacted wherein 50% of all
fish are harvested every year. Let <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> denote the new evolution matrix. How
does <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> compare to <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span>? (<em>Hint</em>. This is more confusing
than it looks at first glance, so don’t just guess the answer; do some
example calculations by hand to check if your proposed matrix <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> makes sense.)</p></li>
<li><p>Like you did above, find the dominant eigenvalue of the system,
and describe the qualitative long-term behavior of the fish population.
Would this harvesting scheme be sustainable over the course of 100
years?</p></li>
<li><p>Experiment to find what approximately what percentage of fish we
can harvest while maintaining an approximately stable population for 100
years.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="part-4-fish-farming-and-early-retirement">Part 4: Fish Farming
and Early Retirement</h2>
<p>You’ve just inherited some money and a fish farm, and you’ve decided
that you’re going to try to run a fish selling business, with the goal
of retiring as early as possible.</p>
<p>You’re starting off with $100,000 in cash, and your plan is to spend
exactly $25,000 every year. We’ll ignore inflation here. Your fish farm
starts off with 10,000 newborn fish. Based on the average weight of fish
at various ages and the going rate of fish in the market, you find
that…</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>harvesting a…</th>
<th>will get you…</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>newborn fish</td>
<td>$10</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>1 year old fish</td>
<td>$30</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>2 year old fish</td>
<td>$50</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>3 year old fish</td>
<td>$20</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Finally, suppose you know that you’ll be able to retire as soon as
you hit $2,000,000. Your job is to figure out a harvesting scheme so
that you hit retirement as soon as possible, and also avoid
bankruptcy.</p>
<p>For example, in the previous part, we discussed a very basic
harvesting scheme: harvest some fixed percentage (ie, 50%) of fish every
year. Here’s a SageMath code snippet that simulates what would happen if
you did this. Note that everything on a line that follows a hash (#) is
a comment; it doesn’t do anything, it’s just there to explain to you
what each step of the code is doing.</p>

<p>Note: If you prefer R, here is an R translation of this code: <a
href="fish.R">fish.R</a>. Many thanks to Hiromi K. for initiating this
translation!</p>
<p>Running this code tells me that I go bankrupt in 11 years. In other
words, this harvesting scheme is no good! The code also outputs me how
much money I have left at the end of each year.</p>
<p>Your job is to adjust the harvesting scheme so that you avoid
bankruptcy and are able to retire as soon as possible. You can start by
experimenting with just varying the percentage of fish harvested yearly,
but you don’t have to harvest a fixed percentage of all the fish every
year. For example, what if you harvest only fish of certain ages? What
if you harvest more fish of certain ages than of other ages? What if you
wait some number of years before starting to harvest? The possibilities
are endless! Be creative :)</p>
<p>You should clearly explain (using full sentences) all of the
harvesting schemes you experimented with in words, and indicate which
one you found to be the best. For the best harvesting scheme you found,
you should also include clearly commented code (like above) that
explains how you ran the simulation (if you only adjusted the part that
says “This is the part you want to edit,” you only need to include that
part of the code).</p>
<p>There are parts of this model that aren’t super realistic (for
instance, depending on what you do, you could wind up with
unrealistically large numbers of fish). If you like, you can treat this
as a kind of linear algebra game! Just so you know, the best harvesting
scheme I’ve been able to come up with gets me to retirement after 12
years. Can you get to retirement faster than me? :)</p>
