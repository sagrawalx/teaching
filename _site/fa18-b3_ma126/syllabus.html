<blockquote>
<p>And what are these fluxions? The velocities of evanescent increments?
And what are these same evanescent increments? They are neither finite
quantities, nor quantities infinitely small, nor yet nothing. May we not
call them ghosts of departed quantities?<br />

<blockquote>
<p>Although the whole of this life were said to be nothing but a dream
and the physical world nothing but a phantasm, I should call this dream
or phantasm real enough, if, using reason well, we were never deceived
by it.<br />

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>MA126 is an introduction to calculus, the branch of mathematics that
studies rates of change and areas. It appeared in its modern form in the
1600s, independently in the works of Gottfried Leibniz and of Isaac
Newton. It led to dramatic advances within mathematics itself, and has
also found widespread applicability throughout science, engineering, and
economics.</p>
<h2 id="course-structure-philosophy">Course Structure Philosophy</h2>
<p>I’m interested in applying evidence-based educational techniques in
the classroom. One such system that I’ve experimented with before and
found to be quite effective is called <em>peer instruction</em>. It was
pioneered by the physicist Eric Mazur at Harvard, and is predicated on
the observation that <em>information transfer</em> (listening to
lectures or reading books) is easier than <em>information
assimilation</em> (solving problems and explaining concepts to others).
So, the idea is to move as much information transfer as possible
<em>out</em> of the classroom (ie, to minimize the time spent listening
to lectures), and as much information assimilation as possible
<em>into</em> the classroom (ie, to maximize the time spent solving
problems and explaining concepts to each other). There’s a growing body
of data that suggests this format is quite effective: by a certain
metric, it seems to lead to an improvement in conceptual understanding
over more traditional methods by over a factor of 2!</p>
<p>Students explaining concepts to each other is a key component of
successful education. If you’re struggling to understand something,
often an explanation from one of your classmates can be very useful
(your classmates are more likely to understand precisely what you’re
struggling with, since they probably struggled with the same thing not
that long ago). Conversely, if you’ve already managed to understand
something, explaining it to a student who’s struggling can really help
solidify your understanding. The peer instruction model builds in
discussion among students inside the classroom. I <em>strongly</em>
encourage all of you to discuss concepts with each other outside of
class as well.</p>
<h2 id="course-mechanics">Course Mechanics</h2>
<p>On the course <a href="/teaching/fa18-b3_ma126">webpage</a>, you’ll
find a calendar that looks like this:</p>
<table style="width: 100%">
<tr>
<th style="width: 10%;">
Day

<th style="width: 20%;">
Topic

<th style="width: 35%;">

A
</td>
<td>

<td>

<td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="3">

</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>This means that, on day A, we will be discussing topic B in class.
You will want to prepare for this by doing reading assignment C
<em>before</em> class. After class, you should be ready to tackle the
problem set D. In E, you’ll find information about any afternoon events
and deadlines that will occur on day A. More details follow.</p>
<h3 id="reading-assignments">Reading assignments</h3>
<p>The reading assignments have two parts: reading some sections from of
the book, and then doing a few exercises to help establish a basic
understanding of the concepts introduced in those sections.</p>
<p>To show that you did the reading assignment, you’ll use an online
form to submit a question that you have about the reading, and to
indicate that you have completed the exercises associated with the
reading assignment. For the day A reading assignment, you’ll submit this
form before 11:59pm the night <em>before</em> day A, and then you’ll
submit a hard copy of the exercises at the beginning of class on day
A.</p>
<p>A few thoughts about these submissions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You might be asking, “What if I don’t have any questions about
the reading?!” That’s fine. You can submit a non-question instead. For
example, you might decide to send me a question that you had, but then
you managed to figure out, either by yourself or by asking someone for
help. Or you might send me something that you understand but you think
one of your peers might find confusing. I’m mostly looking for an
indication that you read the assigned reading and made a sincere attempt
to process it.</p></li>
<li><p>Remember that you don’t necessarily need to wait till the night
before day A to work on and submit the reading assignment for day A.
You’re strongly encouraged to get ahead.</p></li>
<li><p>I’ll do my best to tailor our in-class discussions to address as
many of your questions as I can. The earlier you send me your question,
the more likely I am to be able to work it into our discussions. If I
don’t address your question in class or via email, please find me during
office hours and ask again!</p></li>
<li><p>I’ll check your solutions to the reading assignment exercises
only for completeness. They’ll always be odd-numbered problems, and
you’re encouraged to check your answers to the reading assignment
exercises in the back of the book.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="in-class-structure">In-class structure</h3>
<p>I’ll begin class with a very brief discussion of the reading. This is
not intended to be a substitute for having done the reading. Instead,
the idea is to refresh your memory about what we’ll be discussing in
class today by working through an couple of examples.</p>
<p>We’ll spend most of class time solving problems in the following
format.</p>
<ul>
<li>I’ll put a problem on the board.</li>
<li>You’ll think about the problem by yourself for a couple of
minutes.</li>
<li>We’ll vote on an answer to the problem.</li>
<li>You’ll have a few minutes to talk to your classmates about the
problem.</li>
<li>We’ll vote again.</li>
<li>I’ll tell you how I’d solve the problem.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, the end of class will be more open-ended. You’ll have a
little bit of time to ask me or your classmates to help you with
whatever you’re struggling on.</p>
<h3 id="problem-sets">Problem sets</h3>
<p>After class, you will hopefully be ready to tackle the problem set
listed in the fourth column of the calendar. These problem sets will be
due in batches 4 times throughout the block. Only the problems that are
multiples of 4 will be graded, but it is strongly recommended that you
do all of them. Practice is the name of the game!</p>
<h2 id="assessment">Assessment</h2>
<p>Grades will be calculated as follows.</p>

<p>Here are some details about each of the components of your grade.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Every reading assignment you submit is worth up to 2 points: 1
for the question, 1 for the exercises. The reading assignments component
of your grade will be the total number of points you accumulate in this
way, out of a maximum of <span class="math inline">\(2(n-2)\)</span>
points, where <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the total number
of reading assignments assigned. In other words, you don’t need to do
submit both things every day to get a perfect score for this component
of your grade.</p></li>
<li><p>Problem sets will be collected in batches on quiz/exam days. Only
the problems that are multiples of 4 will be graded (a random subset
will be graded for correctness, and you’ll get completion points for the
rest).</p>
<p>We’ll also do a “zombie project” in the middle of the block. It’ll
count as a problem set.</p></li>
<li><p>There will be a short writing assignment towards the beginning of
the block. You’ll find more details on the <a
href="/teaching/fa18-b3_ma126">webpage</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>There will be three quizzes during the block. They will take
place in the afternoons (see the calendar on the course <a
href="/teaching/fa18-b3_ma126">webpage</a> for the dates and times).
There will be some free response questions, and some true-false
questions. No books, notes, or electronic devices will be permitted.</p>
<p>A day or two after the quiz, I’ll block off a couple of hours in the
afternoons for “quiz revisions.” During this time, you can come by and
meet with me one-on-one to discuss up to 2 of the true-false questions
that you left blank. If you convince me that you now fully understand
the solution, you’ll get points for that question.</p>
<p>If you know that you won’t be able to to make it to a quiz, please
reach out to me as soon as possible!</p></li>
<li><p>The final exam will be on the fourth Tuesday, at the usual class
time. The format will be similar to that of quizzes 1 and 2, except that
the final will be longer than the quizzes, and there won’t be any
“revisions.”</p>
<p>If your score on the final exam is higher than your lowest quiz
score, I’ll use the final exam score to replace the lowest quiz
score.</p></li>
<li><p>There will be a poster session on the last day of class. You’ll
have to put together a poster about a topic related to calculus. You’ll
find more details on the <a
href="/teaching/fa18-b3_ma126">webpage</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>You’ll get a full score for the participation component of your
grade as long as I am able to see that you are putting in a good faith
effort to engage with the class. If at any point during the block I
think that you might not get a full participation score, I’ll reach out
and let you know what you need to be doing to get a full participation
score.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="accommodations">Accommodations</h2>
<p>If you anticipate or experience any disability-related barriers to
your learning in this course, please discuss your concerns with me as
soon as possible and we’ll find a way to provide the accommodations that
you need. Also, please contact the office of <a
href="https://www.coloradocollege.edu/offices/accessibilityresources/">Accessibility
Resources</a> if you have not done so already.</p>
<h2 id="honor-code">Honor code</h2>
<p>Please make sure that you are familiar with the <a
href="https://www.coloradocollege.edu/other/honorcouncil/">Honor
Code</a> at CC. Violations of the Honor Code will have to be reported to
the Honor Council, which is really no fun for anyone.</p>
<h2 id="advice">Advice</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>Mens sana in corpore sano</em>. It is very challenging to get
caught up after being ill, especially on the block plan. I encourage you
to make sure that you’re getting enough sleep, that you’re eating well,
and that you’re staying physically active. Take care of yourself!</li>
<li>If you do happen to get sick, please stay home to avoid getting your
classmates sick, and let me know so that we can figure out how you’ll
make up class work.</li>
<li>The structure of this class will require you to be proactive about
your learning. If you need help developing good study habits, please ask
me for help and I’ll be happy to help.</li>
<li>Reading math can be challenging: you have to read slowly, and pause
constantly to ask yourself if you really understood the last sentence
you just read.</li>
