<main>
<h1 id="problem-sets">Problem Sets</h1>
<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>Solve any 5 of the problems from each problem set and TeX up
solutions to them. Note that some problems of these may be significantly
harder than others.</p>
<p><em>Deadlines</em>. There will be two deadlines for each problem set:
a draft deadline, and a final deadline. The draft deadline is optional:
you need not submit anything, but you’ll get feedback on anything you do
submit. The final deadline is, well, final. The very last problem set
will jump directly to a final deadline, for time reasons. See the course
<a href="index#calendar">calendar</a> for deadlines.</p>
<p><em>Programming Problems</em>. These problems might require you to
write some code. Feel free to write your code in whatever programming
language you like. Note that these problems will <em>still</em> require
some mathematical forethought. In your TeX document, tell me the answer
you got and describe how and why your code works (there will often be
some proofs involved here). Submit your TeX document through Gradescope
as usual, and then email me a well-commented plaintext file containing
the code you wrote (<code>.py</code>, <code>.sage</code>,
<code>.R</code>, <code>.hs</code>, etc).</p>
<p><em>Grading</em>. I’ll grade each problem out of 5 points, for a
total of 25 points per problem set. In order for you to get full credit
for a problem, your solution must be “thorough,” in the sense that it
must be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Correct. This means that all assertions must be true and the logical
structure of the argument must be sound.</li>
<li>Complete. This means that every assertion you make should be
accompanied with a formal proof, or a reference to a result that’s
proved in the textbooks. You can also use results we’ve proved in class,
but make sure you provide a complete and precise statement of any such
statements. If your solution makes use of an unproved assertion, it is
incomplete, even if that assertion happens to be true.</li>
<li>Written with good “style.” This is a little vague, but there are
many examples of proofs with good “style” in our textbooks. You’ll
notice, for example, that most of the proofs in the textbook are mostly
written in complete sentences. A proof that is written entirely in
symbols, even if correct and complete, is not good “style.” (An
occasional typo or minor grammar issues are fine; this isn’t an English
class!)</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ll be a little strict about all of the above points! Remember that
training your proof-writing skills is a central goal of this class.</p>
<p>If you submit more than 5 solutions, I will start by grading the
first 5 that show up in your <code>pdf</code>. If those 5 are all
thorough, you’ll get 1 point of extra credit for each additional
thorough solution that shows up after that. If any of your first 5
solutions aren’t thorough, the later solutions won’t count for
anything.</p>
<p>You are welcome to order solutions in your document in any order (eg,
descending order of how confident you are about them), but please make
sure to number problems as they are numbered on the problem sets and to
“<a
href="https://help.gradescope.com/article/ccbpppziu9-student-submit-work#submitting_a_pdf">assign
pages</a>” correctly on Gradescope.</p>
<p><em>Getting help</em>. When you first start writing proofs, it’s
natural to feel unsure about your proofs. There are several things you
can do if you feel unsure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get a classmate to read your proof. Have them point out things they
don’t understand.</li>
<li>Submit something by the draft deadline so you get my feedback.</li>
<li>Ask me or Surbhi for help during office hours or problem
sessions.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="syllabus#honor-code"><em>Honor Code</em></a>. You’re allowed
to get help on the problem sets from any of the sources listed above.
Please do not look for solutions on the internet. Make sure that in the
end, your solution is written up in your own words.</p>
<h2 id="A">Problem Set A</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Suppose <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is an equilateral
triangle with integer side lengths. Determine whether each of the
following statements is true. If it is, provide a proof, and if it
isn’t, provide a counterexample.</p>
<ul>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> has even side lengths,
then it has even perimeter.</li>
<li>IF <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> has even perimeter, then
it has even side lengths.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>For any positive integer <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>,
show that there exists a sequence of <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> consecutive composite integers.
<em>Possible hint</em>. Consider the sequence <span
class="math display">\[(n+1)!+2, (n+1)!+3, \dotsc,
(n+1)!+(n+1).\]</span></p>
<p><em>Note</em>. For more about existence statements, see section
7.3.</p></li>
<li><p>Prove that <span class="math display">\[ \frac{n^3}{3} -
\frac{n^2}{2} + \frac{n}{6} \]</span> is an integer for any integer
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Loki has acquired a well-earned reputation as a mischief-maker
among the gods of Asgard. One day, Loki steals the goddess Iðunn’s
apples of eternal youth. With a wide grin on his face, he tells Iðunn
that he’s thinking of a perfect square which has remainder 3 when
divided by 7, and if she tells him what number he’s thinking of, he’ll
return her apples. Iðunn thinks about this for a few minutes, and then
says “…” Loki glumly returns her apples. What did Iðunn say?</p></li>
<li><p>You have just discovered the ruins of a medieval monastery which
has been uninhabited for centuries. One room of the monastery is locked
by an 8-digit combination lock. As you continue exploring, you discover
the diary of a monk who seems to love numbers written in Latin. This
monk writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Numerus perfectissimus inveni! Is est quadratus perfectus et
divisibilis per 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, et 12.<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You suspect this has something to do with the combination lock, so
you pull out your smartphone. Google Translate does a shoddy job
translating out of Latin, but it’s good enough for you to decipher this
passage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have found the most perfect number! It is a perfect square and it
is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You think a bit, calculate a number on your phone, put it into the
combination lock, and… much to your dismay, it doesn’t work. But then
you think a bit more, calculate another number, and put it into the
combination lock. You’re sure this time that it has to be this number,
and indeed, this time, the lock opens! What two numbers did you try?
Explain.</p></li>
<li><p>For a positive integer <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>,
let <span class="math inline">\(R_n\)</span> denote the number whose
decimal representation has 1 repeating <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> times. In other words: <span
class="math display">\[ \begin{aligned} R_1 &amp;= 1 \\ R_2 &amp;= 11 \\
R_3 &amp;= 111 \\ R_4 &amp;= 1111 \\ &amp;\;\;\vdots \end{aligned}
\]</span> For which values of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is
the number <span class="math inline">\(R_n\)</span> divisible by 37?
Formulate and prove a statement of the form “<span
class="math inline">\(R_n\)</span> is divisible by 37 if and only if
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>…”</p>
<p><em>Note</em>. For more about “if and only if” statements, see
section 7.1.</p></li>
<li><p>For every positive integer <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, let <span
class="math inline">\(R_n\)</span> denote the same number described
above. Show that <span class="math inline">\(R_n\)</span> is not a
perfect square if <span class="math inline">\(n \geq 2\)</span>.
<em>Possible hint</em>. What is the remainder of <span
class="math inline">\(R_n\)</span> when divided by 4?</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="B">Problem Set B</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Show that <span class="math inline">\(\gcd(n!+1, (n+1)!+1) =
1\)</span> for any positive integer <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Recall that the Fibonnacci numbers <span
class="math inline">\(F_1, F_2, F_3, \dotsc\)</span> are defined by
declaring <span class="math inline">\(F_1 = F_2 = 1\)</span> and then
recursively defining <span class="math inline">\(F_{n+2} = F_{n+1} +
F_n\)</span>. For example: <span class="math display">\[ \begin{aligned}
F_3 &amp;= F_2 + F_1 = 1 + 1 = 2 \\
F_4 &amp;= F_3 + F_2 = 2 + 1 = 3 \\
F_5 &amp;= F_4 + F_3 = 3 + 2 = 5 \\
&amp;\;\,\vdots \end{aligned} \]</span> Prove that <span
class="math inline">\(F_1^2 + \dotsb + F_n^2 = F_nF_{n+1}\)</span> for
all <span class="math inline">\(n \geq 1\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is a positive
composite integer. Show that <span class="math inline">\((n-1)! \equiv 0
\pmod{n}\)</span> if and only if <span class="math inline">\(n \neq
4\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>For which positive integers <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is <span
class="math inline">\(\log_2(n)\)</span> a rational number? Formulate a
statement of the form “<span class="math inline">\(\log_2(n)\)</span> is
rational if and only if…,” and then prove your statement.</p></li>
<li><p>Is it true that, for every positive integer <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, the number <span
class="math inline">\((1 + \sqrt{2})^n\)</span> can be written in the
form <span class="math inline">\(a_n + b_n\sqrt{2}\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(a_n\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(b_n\)</span> are relatively prime integers? If so,
prove it. If not, provide a counterexample.</p></li>
<li><p>(Programming) Qwmqwm is a mathematicalien. Whenever she chooses a
favorite number <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, her body
reconfigures itself so that it has <span
class="math inline">\(T(n)\)</span> tentacles, where <span
class="math display">\[ T(n) = \sum_{k = 1}^{n-1} \gcd(n+k,n-k).
\]</span> Qwmqwm has just chosen her favorite number to be
7568640000000083, which happens to be prime. How many tentacles does she
now have?</p>
<p><em>Note</em>. Qwmqwm’s favorite number is quite large, so you
probably won’t be able to brute force this? Try to find a pattern that
you can use as a basis for a quick algorithm, and make sure you provide
some proof that the pattern you found actually holds.</p></li>
<li><p>(Programming) For every positive integer <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, define an integer <span
class="math inline">\(f(n)\)</span> as follows. First we arrange the
numbers <span class="math inline">\(0, 1, 2, \dotsc, n-1\)</span> in
order around a circle. Starting from 0, we then alternate between
keeping and eliminating numbers: 0 is kept, 1 is eliminated, 2 is kept,
3 is eliminated, and so forth. We keep going around the circle, ignoring
numbers that have already been eliminated and alternating between
keeping and eliminating, until we’re finally just left with one
uneliminated number. That final number is <span
class="math inline">\(f(n)\)</span>. For example, you should be able to
verify that:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \begin{aligned} f(1) &amp;= 0 \\ f(2)
&amp;= 0 \\ f(3) &amp;= 2 \\ f(4) &amp;= 0 \\ f(5) &amp;= 2 \\ \vdots
\end{aligned} \]</span></p>
<p>Calculate <span class="math inline">\(\displaystyle \sum_{n =
1}^{1,000,000} f(n)\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Submit a solution to a problem from any previous problem set that
you haven’t gotten any points for so far.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="C">Problem Set C</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>In the country of Ittaidoushite, the post office issues only
3-cent and 7-cent stamps. Explicitly describe all of the postage amounts
that are possible in Ittaidoushite, and prove that your description is
correct.</p></li>
<li><p>Prove that <span class="math display">\[ \frac{\gcd(m,n)}{n}
\binom{n}{m} \]</span> is an integer for all positive integers <span
class="math inline">\(n \geq m\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Prove that an integer is a perfect square if and only if its
square root is rational.</p>
<p><em>Note</em>. This is an “if and only if” statement, so make sure
you address both directions of the biconditional, even if there’s not
much to say for one of the directions!</p></li>
<li><p>Prove that <span class="math inline">\((1+a)^n \geq 1+na\)</span>
for any real number <span class="math inline">\(a \geq 0\)</span> and
any integer <span class="math inline">\(n \geq 0\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose <span class="math inline">\(p_1, p_2, \dotsc,
p_d\)</span> are distinct primes. Show that <span
class="math display">\[\frac{1}{p_1} + \frac{1}{p_2} + \dotsb +
\frac{1}{p_d}\]</span> is never an integer.</p></li>
<li><p>(Programming) Let’s say that a positive integer <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is <em>qrime</em><a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> if
there exists a non-negative integer <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(n/2^k\)</span> is prime. For example, there are 16
total qrime numbers less than or equal to 20 — namely:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20.
</div>
<p>How many qrime numbers are less than or equal to 100,000?</p></li>
<li><p>(Programming) A mysterious order of technomonks has developed an
arcane alphabet with 13 letters. They believe that all of the names of
God are enumerated by strings of lengths 1 through 13 in this alphabet,
except those strings in which a single letter occurs more than 3 times
in succession. When all of the names of God have been listed, they
believe that the universe will blink out of existence. To bring about
this eschatological end, they’ve written a computer program that will
print out exactly one name of God every second. In how many years will
the universe blink out of existence?<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Submit a solution to a problem from any previous problem set that
you haven’t gotten any points for so far.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="D">Problem Set D</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>There are 63 piles of bananas with <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> bananas each, and 7 additional bananas.
All of these bananas are divided evenly among 23 travelers. How many
bananas can be in each pile? (Describe the set of all possible values of
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.)</p></li>
<li><p>A band of 17 pirates stole a sack of gold coins. When they tried
to divide the fortune into equal portions, 3 coins remainded. In the
ensuing brawl over who should get the extra coins, one pirate was
killed. The wealth was redistributed, but this time an equal division
left 10 coins. Again an argument developed in which another pirate was
killed. But now the total fortune was evenly distributed among the
survivors. What was the least number of coins that could have been
stolen?</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> are nonzero integers and <span
class="math inline">\(\gcd(a,b) = 1\)</span>. Prove that <span
class="math inline">\(a^{\phi(b)} + b^{\phi(a)} \equiv 1
\pmod{ab}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Define a sequence of integers recursively by declaring <span
class="math inline">\(S_1 = 1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(S_2
= 2\)</span>, and <span class="math display">\[ S_{n+2} = 2S_{n+1} + S_n
\]</span> for all positive <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. How
many divisions must the Euclidean algorithm perform when computing <span
class="math inline">\(\gcd(S_{n+1}, S_n)\)</span> before it finds a
remainder of 0? What is this gcd? How would your answers to these
questions change if the initial conditions used to define the sequence
were <span class="math inline">\(S_1 = 14\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(S_2 = 49\)</span> instead?</p></li>
<li><p>Calculate the remainder when <span
class="math inline">\(76^{76^{76}}\)</span> is divided by 7. Justify
your answer.</p>
<p><em>Note</em>. <span class="math inline">\(76^{76^{76}}\)</span>
means <code>76^(76^76)</code>, not <code>(76^76)^76</code>. Those are
different numbers! Also, the number <span
class="math inline">\(76^{76^{76}}\)</span> is monstrously large. Its
binary representation would have roughly <span
class="math inline">\(10^{143}\)</span> digits. Estimates for the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddington_number">number of protons
in the observable universe</a> run around <span
class="math inline">\(10^{80}\)</span>. In other words, no computer
known to humans has even <em>remotely</em> enough room to explicitly
represent a number like <span
class="math inline">\(76^{76^{76}}\)</span>. Don’t bother trying to
compute this number!</p></li>
<li><p>If you’ve ever done any tutoring, you probably know that students
learning algebra for the first time will sometimes assert things like
<span class="math inline">\((a+b)^2 = a^2 + b^2\)</span>. This, of
course, is just not true! (Take <span class="math inline">\(a = b =
1\)</span> for a counterexample.) However, it <em>is</em> true that
<span class="math display">\[ (a+b)^p \equiv a^p + b^p \bmod{p}
\]</span> for <span class="math inline">\(a, b \in \Z\)</span> and any
prime number <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. Prove this
fact.</p></li>
<li><p>(Programming) The distant planet of Primalia is home to a species
of undying multibodied aliens. Each Primalian has a single consciousness
distributed over multiple bodies. The <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>th Primalian to be born on Primalia has
<span class="math inline">\(B(k)\)</span> bodies, where <span
class="math inline">\(B(k)\)</span> is computed as follows. First, let
<span class="math inline">\(p_k\)</span> be the <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>th largest odd prime number starting
with <span class="math inline">\(p_1 = 5\)</span>. Then <span
class="math inline">\(B(k)\)</span> is the remainder after dividing
<span class="math inline">\((p_k-4)!\)</span> by <span
class="math inline">\(p_k\)</span>. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first Primalian has <span class="math inline">\(B(1) =
1\)</span> body since <span class="math inline">\(p_1 = 5\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\((p_1 - 4)! = 1! = 1\)</span> has remainder 1
when divided by 5.</li>
<li>The second Primalian has <span class="math inline">\(B(2) =
2\)</span> bodies since <span class="math inline">\(p_2 = 7\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\((p_2 - 4)! = 3! = 6\)</span> has remainder 6
when divided by 7.</li>
<li>The third Primalian has <span class="math inline">\(B(3) =
2\)</span> bodies since <span class="math inline">\(p_3 = 11\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\((p_3 - 4)! = 7! = 5040\)</span> has
remainder 2 when divided by 11.</li>
</ul>
<p>The 100,000th Primalian has just been born. How many total bodies are
there on Primalia?</p></li>

(congruence classes of) integers <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>
satisfy <span class="math inline">\(x^3 \equiv 1 \bmod{pq}\)</span>?
Justify.</p>
<p><em>Hint</em>. The number of solutions to this congruence depends on
the congruence classes of the primes mod 3. In other words, you’ll have
to fill in all of the blank entries in the following table, where each
entry in the table will be the number of solutions to <span
class="math inline">\(x^3 \equiv 1 \bmod{pq}\)</span>.</p>
<div>
<table style="margin: auto; text-align: center;">
<tr>

<span class="math inline">\(p \equiv 0 \bmod{3}\)</span>
</td>
<td>
<span class="math inline">\(p \equiv 1 \bmod{3}\)</span>
</td>

<span class="math inline">\(p \equiv 2 \bmod{3}\)</span>

<p>Some of the entries in the above table will repeat. Note that this
problem is much harder when <span class="math inline">\(p = q\)</span>,
so you can assume that <span class="math inline">\(p \neq q\)</span>,
and that is why one of the entries above is marked N/A.</p></li>
<li><p>Let’s say that a <em>palindrome</em> is a positive number whose
decimal representation reads the same backward as forward. For instance,
373 and 5225 are palindromes.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>
<p>Show that every palindrome with an even number of digits is divisible
by 11.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give three examples of palindromes with an odd number of digits: (i)
one which is not divisible by 11, (ii) one which is divisible by 11 and
whose middle digit is not 0, and (iii) one which is divisible by 11 and
whose middle digit is 0.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suppose <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> has is a palindrome
with an odd number of digits and that it is divisible by 11. Let <span
class="math inline">\(a_r a_{r-1} \dotsc a_1 a_0\)</span> be its decimal
representation, where <span class="math inline">\(a_0, \dotsc, a_r \in
\{0, \dotsc, 9\}\)</span>. Note that, since <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> has an odd number of digits, <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is an even number and <span
class="math inline">\(a_{r/2}\)</span> is the middle digit of <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span> be the number represented by the
“bottom half of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>” (excluding the
middle digit), ie, by the decimal representation <span
class="math inline">\(a_{(r/2)-1} \dotsb a_1 a_0\)</span>. Show that
<span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is divisible by 11 if and only if
<span class="math inline">\(a_{r/2} = 0\)</span>.</p>

<li><p>Let <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> be an odd prime and
<span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> a primitive root of <span
