<h1 id="resources">Resources</h1>
<p>Here are some resources that you might use to understand things better. If you run into other resources that you find helpful, please share them with me so that I can share them with the class! I’d especially be interested in hearing about reliable freely available resources, and non-English language resources.</p>
<p>You might consider using the following to supplement your understanding of single variable and multivariable derivatives.</p>
<ul>
<li>Protter and Morrey. <em>A First Course in Real Analysis</em>. 2nd Edition.
<ul>
<li>You probably used this book for real analysis 1. Chapter 4 is single variable derivatives. Chapter 7 is multivariable derivatives (except that the inverse function theorem is in Chapter 14).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Callahan. <em>Advanced Calculus: A Geometric View</em>.
<ul>
<li>This is a nice book with lots of pictures. I highly recommend checking it out. Chapters 1 through 5 cover single variable and multivariable derivatives. If I had to pick one more topic from this book to include in our course, it would be Chapter 7, “Critical Points.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Munkres. <em>Analysis on Manifolds</em>.
<ul>
<li>Chapter 2 covers multivariable differentiation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Rudin. <em>Principles of Mathematical Analysis</em>. 3rd Edition.
<ul>
<li>This is the classical real analysis textbook. It’s very challenging to read, but well worth the effort. Chapter 5 is single variable derivatives, and chapter 9 is multivariable derivatives.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Spivak. <em>Calculus on Manifolds</em>.
<ul>
<li>Chapter 2 covers multivariable differentiation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Trench. <em>Introduction to Real Analysis</em>.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://digitalcommons.trinity.edu/mono/7/">Freely available online</a>. Chapter 2 talks about single variable derivatives, and chapters 5-6 talk about multivariable derivatives.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>And you might consider using the following to supplement your readings on manifolds and tangent spaces.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gadea, Muñoz Masqué, and Mykytyuk. <em>Analysis and Algebra on Differentiable Manifolds</em>. 2nd Edition.
<ul>
<li>This is a nice book with lots of problems. Chapter 1 is the one that’s most relevant to our course.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Munkres. <em>Analysis on Manifolds</em>.
<ul>
<li>This was also listed above. Chapters 4 and 5 cover manifolds, though only manifolds that live inside <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span>. Chapter 6 talks about tangent spaces, but its interspersed with things about multilinear algebra that we won’t be discussing.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Spivak. <em>A Comprehensive Introduction to Differential Geometry.</em> Volume 1, 3rd Edition.
<ul>
<li>Chapters 1, 3, and 5 overlap significantly with the latter part of our class. If I had to pick one more topic out of this book to include in our course, it would be Chapter 5, “Vector fields and differential equations.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Tu. <em>An Introduction to Manifolds.</em> 2nd Edition.
<ul>
<li>Sections 1–2, 5–9, and 11–13 are the parts that overlap with our course, but this book contains much, much more information than we’ll be discussing. Section 14 overlaps with chapter 5 of Spivak’s book cited above.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>You may also find Serre’s talk “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJZpdXWm4Gg">How to Write Mathematics Badly</a>” useful for improving your proof writing.</p>
