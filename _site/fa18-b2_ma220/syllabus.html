<h1 id="syllabus">Syllabus</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>… while we expect to get numbers out of the machine, we also expect
to take action based on them, and, therefore we need to understand
thoroughly what numbers may, or may not, mean. To cite the author’s
favorite motto, “The purpose of computing is insight, not
numbers.”<br />

<blockquote>
<p>There is hardly any theory which is more elementary [than linear
algebra], in spite of the fact that generations of professors and
textbook writers have obscured its simplicity by preposterous
calculations with matrices.<br />
<span class="blockquote-attribution">—Jean Dieudonné</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>MA220 is an introduction to <em>linear algebra</em>, the field of
mathematics that seeks to understand the geometry of lines, planes, and
hyperplanes, and of the transformations between them. It’s an elegant
theory in and of itself, but it also has remarkable applications that
span wide expanses of human knowledge. In this class, we’ll explore both
the theory of linear algebra and its applications across many
disciplines.</p>
<h2 id="course-structure-philosophy">Course Structure Philosophy</h2>
<p>I’m interested in applying evidence-based educational techniques in
the classroom. One such system that I’ve experimented with once before
and found to be quite effective is called <em>peer instruction</em>. It
was pioneered by the physicist Eric Mazur at Harvard, and is predicated
on the observation that <em>information transfer</em> (listening to
lectures or reading books) is easier than <em>information
assimilation</em> (solving problems and explaining concepts to others).
So, the idea is to move as much information transfer as possible
<em>out</em> of the classroom (ie, to minimize the time spent listening
to lectures), and as much information assimilation as possible
<em>into</em> the classroom (ie, to maximize the time spent solving
problems and explaining concepts to each other). There’s a growing body
of data that suggests this format is quite effective: by a certain
metric, it seems to lead to an improvement in conceptual understanding
over more traditional methods by over a factor of 2!</p>
<p>Students explaining concepts to each other is a key component of
successful education. If you’re struggling to understand something,
often an explanation from one of your classmates can be very useful
(your classmates are more likely to understand precisely what you’re
struggling with, since they probably struggled with the same thing not
that long ago). Conversely, if you’ve already managed to understand
something, explaining it to a student who’s struggling can really help
solidify your understanding. The peer instruction model builds in
discussion among students inside the classroom. I <em>strongly</em>
encourage all of you to discuss concepts with each other outside of
class as well.</p>
<h2 id="course-mechanics">Course Mechanics</h2>
<p>On the course <a href="/teaching/fa18-b2_ma220">webpage</a>, you’ll
find a calendar that looks like this:</p>
<table style="width: 100%">
<tr>
<th style="width: 10%;">
Day
</th>
<th style="width: 20%;">
Topic
</th>
<th style="width: 35%;">

<th style="width: 35%;">

<tr>
<td rowspan="2">
A
</td>
<td>
B
</td>
<td>
C
</td>
<td>
D
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="3">
E
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>This means that, on day A, we will be discussing topic B in class.
You will want to prepare for this by doing reading assignment C
<em>before</em> class. After class, you should be ready to tackle the
problem set D. In E, you’ll find information about any afternoon events
and deadlines that will occur on day A. More details follow.</p>
<h3 id="reading-assignments">Reading assignments</h3>
<p>The reading assignments have two parts: reading some sections from of
the book, and then doing a few exercises to help establish a basic
understanding of the concepts introduced in those sections.</p>
<p>To show that you did the reading assignment, you’ll use an online
form to submit a question that you have about the reading, and to
indicate that you have completed the exercises associated with the
reading assignment. For the day A reading assignment, you’ll submit this
form before 11:59pm the night <em>before</em> day A, and then you’ll
submit a hard copy of the exercises at the beginning of class on day
A.</p>
<p>A few thoughts about these submissions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You might be asking, “What if I don’t have any questions about
the reading?!” That’s fine. You can submit a non-question instead. For
example, you might decide to send me a question that you had, but then
you managed to figure out, either by yourself or by asking someone for
help. Or you might send me something that you understand but you think
one of your peers might find confusing. I’m mostly looking for an
indication that you read the assigned reading and made a sincere attempt
to process it.</p></li>
<li><p>I’ll do my best to tailor our in-class discussions to address as
many of your questions as I can. The earlier you send me your question,
the more likely I am to be able to work it into our discussions. If I
don’t address your question in class or via email, please find me during
office hours and ask again!</p></li>
<li><p>I’ll check your solutions to the exercises for completeness.
Hefferon provides an answer key for all of the exercises in the
textbook, and you are encouraged to check your solutions for correctness
yourself.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="in-class-structure">In-class structure</h3>
<p>I’ll begin class with a very brief discussion of the reading (ideally
no longer than 30 minutes). This is not intended to be a substitute for
having done the reading. Instead, the idea is to refresh your memory
about what we’ll be discussing in class today.</p>
<p>We’ll spend most of class time solving problems in the following
format.</p>
<ul>
<li>I’ll put a problem on the board.</li>
<li>You’ll think about the problem by yourself for a couple of
minutes.</li>
<li>We’ll vote on an answer to the problem.</li>
<li>You’ll have a few minutes to talk to your classmates about the
problem.</li>
<li>We’ll vote again.</li>
<li>I’ll tell you how I’d solve the problem.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, the end of class will be more open-ended. You’ll have a
little bit of time to ask me or your classmates to help you with
whatever you’re struggling on.</p>
<h3 id="problem-sets">Problem sets</h3>
<p>After class, you will hopefully be ready to tackle the problem set
listed in the fourth column of the calendar. Some of those will be
identical to (or closely related to) problems we already discussed in
class.</p>
<p>The problem sets will not be collected, but the quizzes and the final
exam will draw <em>very heavily</em> from these problem sets. You can
check your answers against Hefferon’s solutions. If you have a solution
to a problem that you think is correct but is different from Hefferon’s
solution, let’s discuss it during office hours! I have already found at
least one error in the solutions manual.</p>
<h2 id="assessment">Assessment</h2>
<p>Grades will be calculated as follows.</p>
<table>

<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">Reading assignments</td>

<p>Here are some details about each of the components of your grade.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Every reading assignment you submit is worth up to 2 points: 1
for the question, 1 for the exercises. The reading assignments component
of your grade will be the total number of points you accumulate in this
way, out of a maximum of <span class="math inline">\(2(n-2)\)</span>
points, where <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the total number
of reading assignments assigned. In other words, you don’t need to do
submit both things every day to get a perfect score for this component
of your grade.</p></li>
<li><p>There will be a short writing assignment towards the beginning of
the block. You’ll find more details on the <a
href="/teaching/fa18-b2_ma220">webpage</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>There will be three quizzes during the block. They will take
place in the afternoons (see the calendar on the course <a
href="/teaching/fa18-b2_ma220">webpage</a> for the dates and times).
There will be some free response questions, and some true-false
questions. No books, notes, or electronic devices will be permitted.</p>
<p>A day or two after the quiz, I’ll block off a few hours in the
afternoons for “quiz revisions.” During this time, you can come by and
meet with me one-on-one to discuss up to 2 of the true-false questions
that you left blank. If you convince me that you now fully understand
the solution, you’ll get points for that question.</p>
<p>If you know that you won’t be able to to make it to a quiz, please
reach out to me as soon as possible!</p></li>
<li><p>The final exam will be on the fourth Tuesday, at the usual class
time. The format will be similar to that of quizzes 1 and 2, except that
the final will be longer than the quizzes, and there won’t be any
“revisions.”</p>
<p>If your score on the final exam is higher than your lowest quiz
score, I’ll use the final exam score to replace the lowest quiz
score.</p></li>
<li><p>On the last day of class, we’ll have a poster session. There will
be more details on the course <a
href="/teaching/fa18-b2_ma220">webpage</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>You’ll get a full score for the participation component of your
grade as long as I am able to see that you are putting in a good faith
effort to engage with the class. If at any point during the block I
think that you might not get a full participation score, I’ll reach out
and let you know what you need to be doing to get a full participation
score.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="accommodations">Accommodations</h2>
<p>If you anticipate or experience any disability-related barriers to
your learning in this course, please discuss your concerns with me as
soon as possible and we’ll find a way to provide the accommodations that
you need. Also, please contact the office of <a
href="https://www.coloradocollege.edu/offices/accessibilityresources/">Accessibility
Resources</a> if you have not done so already.</p>
<h2 id="honor-code">Honor code</h2>
<p>Please make sure that you are familiar with the <a
href="https://www.coloradocollege.edu/other/honorcouncil/">Honor
Code</a> at CC. Violations of the Honor Code will have to be reported to
the Honor Council, which is no fun for anyone.</p>
<h2 id="advice">Advice</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>Mens sana in corpore sano</em>. It is very challenging to get
caught up after being ill, especially on the block plan. I encourage you
to make sure that you’re getting enough sleep, that you’re eating well,
and that you’re staying physically active. Take care of yourself!</li>
<li>If you do happen to get sick, please stay home to avoid getting your
classmates sick, and let me know so that we can figure out how you’ll
make up class work.</li>
<li>The structure of this class will require you to be proactive about
your learning. If you need help developing good study habits, please ask
me for help and I’ll be happy to assist you.</li>
<li>Reading math can be challenging: you have to read slowly, and pause
constantly to ask yourself if you really understood the last sentence
you just read.</li>
<li>You may quickly find that row reduction is a very tedious process to
do by hand. Once you feel confident that you know how to do it by hand,
I encourage you to figure out how to get a computer to row reduce
matrices for you.</li>
