<h1 id="exams">Exams</h1>
<h2 id="mt1">Midterm 1</h2>
<p>The exam will take place during class and you will have 50 minutes.
You will be allowed to use a <em>one two-sided handwritten sheet of
notes</em>. No other resources will be allowed (in particular, no
calculators). The exam will cover everything up through the w3wed
reading on “Random Variables.” There are 12 problems. The problems
resemble CC problems, in-class problems, and/or FP problems.</p>
<h2 id="mt2">Midterm 2</h2>
<p>The exam will take place during class and you will have 50 minutes.
You will be allowed to use a <em>one two-sided handwritten sheet of
notes</em>. No other resources will be allowed (in particular, no
calculators). The exam cover everything up through the w7wed reading on
“Inference: 1 Categorical Variable.” There are 12 problems. The problems
resemble CC problems, in-class problems, and/or FP problems.</p>
<p>The exam is cumulative, but the emphasis is on newer material (ie,
w3fri onwards). You will need to know how to calculate an antiderivative
of a function of the form <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = \lambda
e^{-\lambda x}\)</span> (ie, the probability density function of an
exponential distribution). Problems that involve calculations that
require software or probability tables will be marked with an asterisk
(*); since you will not have access to either, you will be asked to go
as far as you can without software and then express your answer in terms
of the functions in the following table:</p>
<table id="cdf-table">
<tr>
<th>
Distribution
</th>
<th>
Observation to percentile
</th>
<th>
Percentile to observation
</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Standard Normal
</td>
<td>
<code>pnorm(-)</code>
</td>
<td>
<code>qnorm(-)</code>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
T Distribution (<code>df</code>)
</td>
<td>
<code>pt(-, df)</code>
</td>
<td>
<code>qt(-, df)</code>
</td>
</tr>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Chi-square Distribution (<code>df</code>)
</td>
<td>
<code>pchisq(-, df)</code>
</td>
<td>
<code>qchisq(-, df)</code>
</td>

</table>
<h2 id="corrections">Midterm Corrections</h2>
<p>After each midterm, you can do corrections to earn back some points
that you missed. The maximum number of points you can earn back is
capped at 10% of the total number of points on the midterm. You will
earn back 0.5 points for each problem that you “correct,” where
correcting a problem means writing up thorough responses to all of the
following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
<li>
What is the correct solution? (Write it out completely! Do not refer
back to your midterm.)
</li>
<li>
What specifically was incorrect about your solution on the midterm? What
are the key concepts involved in this problem that you didn’t understand
at the time?
</li>
<li>
What resources did you use to help you get to the correct solution?
</li>
</ol>
<p>You must respond to all three parts to receive credit. You can use
any resources you like (classmates, instructor, TA, office hours, …) to
get to the correct solution, but your responses to all of the questions
should ultimately be written up in your own words.</p>
<p>Deadlines for corrections are indicated on the <a
href="index#schedule">schedule</a>. Submit your corrections through
Gradescope. If you submit a single PDF, you must correctly “<a
href="https://help.gradescope.com/article/ccbpppziu9-student-submit-work">assign
pages</a>” to your submission.</p>
<h2 id="final">Final Exam</h2>
<p>The exam will be virtual and asynchronous.</p>
<h3 id="logistics">Logistics</h3>
<p>The exam will be available through Gradescope between Saturday 6/10
8:00am PT and Thursday 6/15 2:30pm. You can either print out the exam
and work directly on it, or use your own paper. You must finish <a
href="https://help.gradescope.com/article/ccbpppziu9-student-submit-work#submitting_to_your_assignment">submitting
the exam through Gradescope</a> within 3 hours<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> of
when you first access the exam, or by Thursday 6/15 2:30pm,
<em>whichever comes first</em>.</p>
<p>If you like, you can read more about Gradescope’s “timed assignments”
<a
href="https://help.gradescope.com/article/ccbpppziu9-student-submit-work#understanding_timed_assignments">here</a>.</p>
<p>Late exams and exams sent via Zulip DM (or email or any other means)
<em>will not be accepted</em>. It is your responsibility to situate
yourself somewhere with a stable internet connection and to make sure
that you give yourself enough time to scan, upload, and submit the
exam.</p>
<p>Please note that submission includes “assigning pages” if you <a
href="https://help.gradescope.com/article/ccbpppziu9-student-submit-work#submitting_a_pdf">submit
a PDF</a> (this is not relevant if you <a
href="https://help.gradescope.com/article/ccbpppziu9-student-submit-work#submitting_an_online_assignment">submit
individual images</a>). It is very important that you make sure to
“assign pages” because the final exam will have to be graded on a time
crunch; there won’t be time to deal with regrade requests due to
incorrectly assigned pages.</p>
<p>Gradescope is scheduled to undergo <a
href="https://gradescope.statuspage.io/incidents/jxtyttfs0076">maintainance</a>
on Sunday 6/11 8:00–8:30am PT. You will not be able to submit during
this time, so please ensure that you do not start the exam at a time
that would require you to submit during this maintenance window.</p>
<h3 id="resources">Resources</h3>
<p>You are allowed to use <em>one two-sided handwritten sheet of
notes</em>. No other resources are allowed.</p>
<p>Software or calculators will not be necessary. Like on midterm 2, you
will be asked to go as far as you can by hand and then express your
answers in terms of the functions in the <a href="#cdf-table">same
table</a>.</p>
<p>Please do not discuss exam problems with classmates who haven’t yet
taken the exam yet, either in person or online (eg, on Zulip).</p>
<h3 id="content">Content</h3>
<p>The exam will be cumulative. Material that hasn’t occurred on any
midterm so far (ie, w7fri onwards) will have a <em>slight</em> emphasis.
Exam problems will resemble CC problems, in-class problems, FP problems,
and/or previous midterm problems. There will be a total of 18
problems.</p>
<p>Each problem will be worth 2 points. To ensure that you receive
credit, you must <em>show your work and/or explain your answers</em> and
you must <em>“assign pages” to your Gradescope submission</em>. Make
sure also that you respond to the first problem on the exam, which will
read as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Problem 1.</strong> Sign your name to indicate your agreement
that you will not use any unauthorized resources (which includes
everything except your two-sided handwritten sheet of notes) during this
exam, nor will you provide any unauthorized aid to others. <em>If you
skip this signature, you will receive a 0 on the entire exam!</em></p>
</blockquote>
