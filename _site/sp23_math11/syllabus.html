<blockquote>
<p>Statistical thinking will one day be as necessary for efficient
citizenship as the ability to read or write. <span

</blockquote>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The time that H. G. Wells prophesied over a century ago has arrived.
Math 11 is an introduction to statistics, ie, the practice of ethically
collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data.</p>
<p>Key concepts the course will cover include the structure of data,
numerical and graphical summaries of data, p-value hypothesis tests, and
confidence intervals. En route, the course will cover some concepts from
probability which form the mathematical backbone of statistical
analysis.</p>
<h2 id="course-materials">Course Materials</h2>
<h3 id="textbook">Textbook</h3>
<p>By official decree, the textbook for this course is <em>Stats: Data
and Models</em> (5th edition) by De Veaux, Velleman, and Bock. Please
note that, after two weeks, you’ll be <em>automatically charged</em> by
RedShelf for digital access to this textbook through Canvas, <em>unless
you explicitly <a
href="https://solve.redshelf.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013142634-How-to-Opt-Out">opt
out</a></em>.</p>
<p>The open-source textbook <a
href="https://www.openintro.org/book/os/"><em>OpenIntro
Statistics</em></a> (4th edition) by Diez, Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Barr
covers essentially the same content and is useful. You can download it
from the website for any price you like, including $0. It’s also
available for free in Japanese translation, and there’s a Chinese
translation in progress.</p>
<h3 id="chat-software">Chat Software</h3>
<p>Zulip is chat software (a bit like Discord, Slack, or Piazza), and it
will be our primary means of communication for this class. It’s
open-source and you can use it either in a browser or by installing an
app on any platform. I’ve set up a <a
href="https://sunnysclasses.zulipchat.com/">Zulip organization</a> with
a dedicated stream for our class. You can find an invite link on Canvas.
Register using any name you’d like to use for this class, but you
<em>must</em> use your official <code>...@ucsd.edu</code> email address
as it appears on the class roster. If you don’t have access to the Zulip
invite link, or you don’t have a <code>...@ucsd.edu</code> email
address, please reach out to me to explain the situation right away.</p>
<p>Please use the Zulip class stream to ask any content-related and
logistics-related questions you have. Certain assignments for the course
will ask you to post things to our class stream regularly. The TAs and I
will also use Zulip to make class-related announcements. If you have
private questions about situations specific to you, please use Zulip to
send direct messages (instead of sending emails or Canvas messages).</p>
<h3 id="statistical-software">Statistical Software</h3>
<p>By official decree, you’ll be required to use Minitab to do some
statistical analysis for some lab assignments. See the <a
href="https://mathweb.ucsd.edu/~math11/S23.html">lab webpage</a> for
details.</p>
<p>The open-source software RStudio is a much more powerful and popular
tool for statistcal analysis. It’s most likely what you’ll use if you
analyze data in the future, but it isn’t required for this course. If
you decide you want to play with it, you should <a
href="https://cran.r-project.org/">install R</a> and then <a
href="https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download">install
RStudio</a> on your computer (in that order), and then feel free to ask
me about resources to help you learn how to use it.</p>
<h2 id="course-structure">Course Structure</h2>
<h3 id="philosophy">Philosophy</h3>
<p>No class (or classes) will ever teach you everything you might need
to know about a subject, so in the long run, the most important thing to
learn is how to learn independently: in pedagogical jargon, that’s “how
to be a <em>self-regulated learner</em>.” Research suggests that the
following three things are key aspects of learning how to be a
self-regulated learner of math:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><em>Active reading</em>. Reading math is very different from
other kinds of reading. You can’t read a math textbook the same way you
might read a novel for pleasure if you’re hoping to get anything out of
it. You have to stop constantly to work out exercises and examples
yourself, instead of just reading through them. You have to doodle
pictures to make sure you have some kind of an image in your head of
what’s going on. You have to try to formulate <em>precise</em> questions
about things you don’t understand.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Reciprocal teaching</em>. Talking to your peers about math is
incredibly important. If you don’t understand a particular concept,
you’re much more likely to get an explanation that you actually find
helpful from a peer. If you think you do understand a particular concept
and help a peer who’s struggling, you’ll almost certainly find that the
process of explaining the concept will solidify your own understanding
of it. Learning happens best in community, and it is in your best
interest to make sure you have a mathematical community.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Metacognition</em>. A key part of learning how to learn is
reflecting on your learning and taking the time to ask yourself
questions about your learning. What parts of your study habits are
working well for you? What parts aren’t working and how can you change
these parts? What kind of a mindset do you have towards math, and what
can you be doing to help cultivate a growth mindset in
yourself?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Evidence-based methods for practicing these three things are built
into course structure. It would benefit you to bear these three things
in mind as you go through the course.</p>
<h3 id="class">Class</h3>
<p>This class will be “flipped.” You’ll be expected to read and make a
preliminary attempt to understand material on your own before coming to
class. I’ll typically start class off with a brief summary of your
latest reading. It <em>won’t be a substitute</em> for the reading; in
other words, you shouldn’t expect lectures. We’ll usually spend most of
our time working on problems together.</p>
<p>The class will be podcasted, but you are strongly advised to attend
class and only use the podcast in unusual situations. Take advantage of
your tuition. You’ll miss out on a significant amount of learning if the
podcast is your primary means of engaging with the class.</p>
<h3 id="discussion">Discussion</h3>
<p>You have access to weekly discussion sections run by extremely
knowledgable TAs. These are stellar opportunities for you to develop
your problem-solving skills and to ask questions in a “cozier”
environment. Take advantage of your tuition and attend discussion.</p>
<h3 id="assignments">Assignments</h3>
<p>There will be a few different types of assignments in the course. The
links below describe these assignments in further detail:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="read">Reading Assignments</a>: These involve reading
something, attempting some exercises (“CC”), and formulating a question
about the reading (“RQ”). You’ll usually have 3 of these due every
week.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="reflect">Reflection Assignments</a>: These ask you to
reflect on various aspects of your relationship with mathematics, your
mathematical learning, etc. You’ll have 1 of these due every
week.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://mathweb.ucsd.edu/~math11/S23.html">Labs</a>:
These ask you to play with some data using some statistical software.
You’ll usually have 1 of these due every week.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="exam">Exams</a>: There will be two midterms and a final.
After the midterms (but not the final), you’ll have a chance to do some
<a href="exam#corrections">corrections</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="grades">Grades</h2>
<p>It’s unfortunate that grades exist, but they do, and here’s how
they’ll be determined in this class. First off, please note that, due to
resource limitations, we will not be able to give credit for late
assignments<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> or offer make-up exams.</p>
<p>Numerical scores will be calculated as follows:</p>

You get 1 point for each <a href="read">Reading Assignment</a> for which
you post a valid Reading Question on time, up to a maximum of <span
class="math inline">\(n-4\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the total number of Reading
Assignments that ask you to post an RQ. In other words, you don’t need
to post a Reading Question for every Reading Assignment to get full
credit (and there’s no extra credit for doing so).

there’s no extra credit for doing so).

<p>At the end of the quarter, I may decide to lower some of the above
cutoffs, but I will not increase them.</p>
<h2 id="accommodations">Accommodations</h2>
<p>If you experience disability-related barriers to your learning,
please contact the <a href="https://osd.ucsd.edu/">Office for Students
with Disabilities</a> right away to have them provide a current
Authorization for Accommodation (AFA). The AFA should be received at
least one week in advance of the requested accommodations; we might be
unable to accommodate late requests. If your accommodations compel you
to take an exam at a different time than the rest of the class, you may
be given a different exam of equivalent difficulty.</p>
<h2 id="integrity">Integrity</h2>
<p>Act with integrity. You’ll learn more, and you’ll be practicing good
habits for ethical decisions that you’ll have to make for the rest of
your life. If you have a question about whether something class-related
is integrous, just ask first. Academic integrity violations have to be
reported and result in serious consequences, none of which is any fun
for anyone involved, so please, just don’t do it.</p>
<h2 id="diversity">Diversity</h2>
<p>The pursuit of knowledge thrives in diverse and inclusive
environments. I expect that all of us, myself included, will work
towards making our class a welcoming space for everyone, no matter how
we might identify on race, ethnicity, nationality, socioeconomic
background, gender, sexual orientation, ability, age, and the many other
dimensions of identity. I also encourage you to reach out if there are
ways to have our space be more comfortable for you. If anyone says
anything in class that makes you feel unwelcome, please let me know.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>This appears to be a false attribution — or rather, it
is a paraphrase. In <em>Mankind in the Making</em> (1903), H. G. Wells
writes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The great body of physical science, a great deal of the essential
fact of financial science, and endless social and political problems are
only accessible and only thinkable to those who have had a sound
training in mathematical analysis, and the time may not be very remote
when it will be understood that for complete initiation as an efficient
citizen of one of the new great complex world-wide States that are now
developing, it is as necessary to be able to compute, to think in
averages and maxima and minima, as it is now to be able to read and
write.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was later paraphrased by Samuel S. Wilks in his presidential
address to the American Statistical Association in 1950 in the form
quoted at the top of this syllabus, and this paraphrase has spread under
Wells’s name since then.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"

<li id="fn2"><p>The only exception to the “no late assignments” policy
is the reflection assignments, all of which have an automatic 48-hour
penalty-free grace period. After that grace period expires, there will
be no credit.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back"
