<blockquote>
<p>Algebraic geometry seems to have acquired the reputation of being
esoteric, exclusive, and very abstract, with adherents who are secretly
plotting to take over all the rest of mathematics! In one respect this
last point is accurate… <span class="blockquote-attribution">—David
Mumford, 1975</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>La découverte est le privilege de l’enfant: l’enfant qui n’a pas peur
encore de se tromper, d’avoir l’air idiot, de ne pas faire sérieux, de
ne pas faire comme tout le monde.<br />
[Discovery is the privilege of the child: the child who has no fear of
being wrong again, of looking like an idiot, of not being serious, of
not doing things like everyone else.] <span

</blockquote>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Algebraic geometry could be defined as the branch of mathematics
concerned with describing systems of polynomial equations, just as
linear algebra is the branch concerned with systems of linear equations.
This definition is short, accurate in some respects, and makes an
important analogy: one of the key ideas we’ll explore in this class is a
kind of polynomial generalization of the row reduction algorithm for
systems of linear equations. That being said, this definition also
misses an important point: algebraic geometry is a bustling intellectual
crossroads! Number theorists, combinatorialists, complex analysts,
representation theorists, string theorists, computer scientists,
statisticians, and many others have reason to interact with the subject.
Our goal in this class is to wade into these vast and deep waters.</p>
<h2 id="course-materials">Course Materials</h2>
<h3 id="textbook">Textbook</h3>
<p>See <a href="references">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="zulip">Zulip</h3>
<p>Zulip is chat software (a bit like Discord, Slack, or Piazza), and it
will be our primary means of communication for this class. It’s
open-source and you can use it in a browser (or by installing an app on
any platform). I’ve set up a <a
href="https://sunnysclasses.zulipchat.com/">Zulip organization</a> with
a dedicated stream for our class. You can find an invite link on Canvas.
Register using any name you’d like to use for this class, but you
<em>must</em> use your official <code>...@ucsd.edu</code> email address
as it appears on the class roster. If you don’t have access to the
invite link or you don’t have a <code>...@ucsd.edu</code> email address,
please reach out to me to explain the situation.</p>
<p>Use the Zulip class stream to ask any content-related and
logistics-related questions you have. Certain assignments for the course
will ask you to post things to our class stream regularly. I will also
use Zulip to make class-related announcements. If you have private
questions about situations specific to you, please use Zulip to send
direct messages (instead of emails or Canvas messages, which I may not
respond to).</p>
<h3 id="sage">Sage</h3>
<p>At a few points in the quarter, you may find that computations get
tedious or uninteresting to do by hand. If you find yourself in this
position, I suggest playing around with <a href="sage">Sage</a>.</p>
<h2 id="course-structure">Course Structure</h2>
<h3 id="philosophy">Philosophy</h3>
<p>No class (or classes) will ever teach you everything you might need
to know about a subject. In the long run, the most important thing to
learn is how to learn independently: in pedagogical jargon, that’s “how
to be a <em>self-regulated learner</em>.” Research in education suggests
that the following three things are key aspects of learning how to be a
self-regulated learner of math:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><em>Active reading</em>. Reading math can be very different from
other kinds of reading. You have to stop constantly to work out
exercises and examples yourself, instead of just reading through them.
You have to doodle pictures to make sure you have some kind of an image
in your head of what’s going on. You have to try to formulate
<em>precise</em> questions about things you don’t understand.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Reciprocal teaching</em>. Talking to your peers about math is
important. If you don’t understand a particular concept, you’re more
likely to get an explanation that you actually find helpful from a peer.
If you think you do understand a particular concept and help a peer
who’s struggling, you’ll almost certainly find that the process of
explaining the concept will solidify your own understanding of it.
Learning happens best in community, and it is in your best interest to
make sure you have a mathematical community.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Metacognition</em>. A key part of learning how to learn is
reflecting on your learning and taking the time to ask yourself
questions about your learning. What parts of your study habits are
working well for you? What parts aren’t working and how can you change
these parts? What kind of a mindset do you have towards math, and what
can you be doing to help cultivate a growth mindset in
yourself?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Practicing these three things is built into course structure. It may
benefit you to bear these three things in mind as you go through the
course.</p>
<h3 id="class">Class</h3>
<p>You’ll be expected to read and make a preliminary attempt to
understand material on your own before coming to class. Attendance is
strongly encouraged, but it is not required. The class will not be
podcasted.</p>
<h3 id="assignments">Assignments</h3>
<p>There will be a few different types of assignments in the course:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="read">Reading Assignments</a>: These involve reading
something, attempting some exercises, and formulating a question about
the content. One of these will be due before most class
sessions.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="reflect">Reflection Assignments</a>: These ask you to
reflect on various aspects of your relationship with mathematics, your
mathematical learning, etc. You’ll have about one these due every
week.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="project">Project</a>: You’ll do a project. It’ll be due
at the end of the quarter.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Assignment deadlines are indicated on the <a
href="index#schedule">schedule</a>. Late assignments will not be
accepted.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="quizzes">Quizzes</h3>
<p>There will be 5 <a href="quiz">quizzes</a> over the course of the
quarter. There will be no make-up quizzes.</p>
<h2 id="grades">Grades</h2>
<p>It’s unfortunate that grades exist, but they do. Here’s how they’ll
be determined in this class.</p>
<p>First, numerical scores will be calculated as follows:</p>
<table width="100%">
<tr>
<th width="30%">
Component
</th>
<th width="10%" style="text-align: center;">
%
</th>
<th width="60%">
Details
</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<a href="read">Reading Assignments</a>
</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">
15%
</td>
<td>
You get 1 point for each <a href="read">Reading Assignment (RA)</a> for
which you post a valid Reading Question (RQ) on time, up to a maximum of
<span class="math inline">\(n-4\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the total number of RAs.<a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<a href="reflect">Reflection Assignments</a>
</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">
15%
</td>
<td>
Half of this score is allocated to the 8 <a href="reflect#weekly">Weekly
Reflections (WR)</a>, with one point for each on-time submission. The
remaining half is split evenly between the <a
href="reflect#autobio">Mathematical Autobiography (MA)</a> and the <a
href="reflect#final">Final Reflection (FR)</a>.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<a href="project">Project</a>
</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">
20%
</td>
<td>
Due on the last day of class.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<a href="quiz">Quizzes</a>
</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">
50%
</td>
<td>
All quizzes have equal weight. Your lowest quiz score will be dropped.
There are no make-up quizzes.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Your numerical score will be then converted to a letter grade using
the following cutoffs:</p>
<table width="100%" style="text-align: center;">
<tr>
<th>
A+
</th>
<th>
A
</th>
<th>
A-
</th>
<th>
B+

<th>

<th>

<th>

<th>

<th>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>

</td>
<td>
93
</td>
<td>

<td>

</td>
<td>
83
</td>
<td>

</td>
<td>
77
</td>
<td>

</td>
<td>

</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>At the end of the quarter, I may decide to lower some of the above
cutoffs, but I will not increase them.</p>
<h2 id="accommodations">Accommodations</h2>
<p>If you experience disability-related barriers to your learning,
please contact the <a href="https://osd.ucsd.edu/">Office for Students
with Disabilities</a> right away to have them provide a current
Authorization for Accommodation (AFA). The AFA should be received at
least one week in advance of the requested accommodations. We might be
unable to accommodate late requests.</p>
<h2 id="integrity">Integrity</h2>
<p>Act with integrity. You’ll learn more, and you’ll be practicing good
habits for ethical decisions that you’ll have to make for the rest of
your life. If you have a question about whether something class-related
is integrous, just ask first. Academic integrity violations have to be
reported and result in serious consequences, none of which is any fun
for anyone involved, so please, just don’t do it.</p>
<h2 id="diversity">Diversity</h2>
<p>The pursuit of knowledge thrives in diverse and inclusive
environments. I expect that all of us, myself included, will work
towards making our class a welcoming space for everyone, no matter how
we might identify on race, ethnicity, nationality, socioeconomic
background, gender, sexual orientation, ability, age, and the many other
dimensions of identity. I also encourage you to reach out if there are
ways to have our space be more comfortable for you. If anyone says
anything in class that makes you feel unwelcome, please let me know.</p>
