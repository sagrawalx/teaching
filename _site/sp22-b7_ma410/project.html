<main>
<h1 id="final-project">Final Project</h1>
<p>The goal for the final project is for you to learn about some piece
of number theory that we didn’t talk about in class.</p>
<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Form a group of about 2–4 and choose a topic that’s related to
course material but that we did not cover. There are many possibilities!
You might look through [Nee] for some inspiration (eg, 1.IV, 2.VIII,
3.I.2, 3.VI–IX, 5.IX–XI, 6.I–III, 7.II–VII, 10–12…). You could look into
the Riemann zeta function. You could look into the Riemann mapping
theorem and Schwarz-Christoffel mappings. You could look into an
application of complex analysis to a field of your choosing (the
sections in [Nee] listed above include some sections on applications to
physics). You don’t have to choose something I’ve listed here — try
looking around yourself a bit! Just make sure that your topic involves a
“substantial” application of the ideas we’ve discussed.</p>
<p>During week 3, you’ll be asked to submit a <strong>proposal</strong>.
All you have to do for this is tell me who you’ll be working with and
what you’re planning on doing. Submit it through gradescope as a group
submission by following <a
href="https://help.gradescope.com/article/m5qz2xsnjy-student-add-group-members">these
instructions</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Write up a <strong>document</strong> in which you give a brief
exposition of the topic. It should be written in LaTeX. The length is
flexible (somewhere in the whereabouts of 3 pages might be reasonable).
Make sure to give clear definitions of any new terms. If there’s a
theorem involved whose proof is too long or hard, you can omit the proof
and just provide the statement. Write in a way that a fellow classmate
would be able to understand what you’ve written, and make sure to cite
your sources. Submit the document through gradescope as a group
submission by following <a
href="https://help.gradescope.com/article/m5qz2xsnjy-student-add-group-members">these
instructions</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Prepare an informal and brief (10ish minutes)
<strong>presentation</strong> about your topic for your class. It can
take any format you like (slides, chalk talk, etc). Just make sure
everyone in your group is involved in presenting.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
<p>Your project will be graded out of 20 points, as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>(10 points) Mathematical content. For full credit, make sure that
there’s some substantial mathematical content to whatever you do.</li>
<li>(5 points) Exposition. For full credit, write up your exposition
clearly and precisely, in a way that’s easy to follow. Make sure to cite
your references too.</li>
<li>(5 points) Presentation. For full credit, your presentation should
clearly express the main ideas of what you studied.</li>
</ul>
