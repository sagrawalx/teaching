# Comparing Judson's and Lebl's books

Most of what we'll be discussing is also covered in Judson's [*Ordinary Differential Equations Project*](http://faculty.sfasu.edu/judsontw/ode/) (Jan 11 2019 edition), and you might find it helpful to look at it from time to time.

Here are some specific reasons why you might want to look at Judson's book.

* It has lots of non-(physics/engineering) examples.
* It has detailed explanations of how to get Sage to do calculations and plots for you.
* Section 1.7 in Judson's book might help solidify your understanding of phase diagrams for autonomous first order ODEs.
* Section 3.7 in Judson's book might help solidify your understanding of the eigenvalue method for $2\times2$ first order linear systems with constant coefficients.

Here are some things you should be wary of (mostly involving later topics).

* You'll find more details about the eigenvalue method with defective eigenvalues in Lebl's book than in Judson's.
* You'll find more details about matrix exponentials in Lebl's book than in Judson's.
* Non-homogeneous linear systems do not appear in Judson's book.

Here is a table summarizing equivalent sections.
