<h1 id="sir-project-comments">SIR Project Comments</h1>
<p>Here are some of the common mistakes I noticed when going through the
SIR projects.</p>
<ul>
<li>Part I
<ul>
<li><p>Question 2. I was looking for the observation that b and c are
both forced to be between 0 and 1, since they are both
fractions.</p></li>
<li><p>Question 3. I was looking for something along the lines of the
following: Since <span class="math inline">\(S + I + R = N\)</span> is
constant, we have <span class="math display">\[0 = (S + I + R)&#39; =
S&#39; + I&#39; + R&#39;,\]</span> which means that <span
class="math inline">\(I&#39; = - S&#39; - R&#39;\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Question 5. All of you said that <span class="math inline">\(S
\to 0\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(t \to \infty\)</span>.
That’s fine, and I didn’t take off points for this, but this is not
quite true: all that we know is that <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> must stabilize at some value between 0
and <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> (because it’s monotonically
decreasing and bounded), but there is no guarantee that that value be 0.
This will happen when the disease is not very virulent: recovery happens
quickly (ie, <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is large), and the
disease speads slowly (ie, <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is
small). Here is a picture of this kind of situation. In this plot, we
have <span class="math inline">\(c = 0.5\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(b = 0.01\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(R(0) = 0\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(I(0) = 1\)</span>.

<p>Here’s a question I have: must it be the case that <span
class="math inline">\(I \to 0\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(t
\to \infty\)</span>? It seems like this should be true, and I haven’t
been able to come up with a counterexample, but I don’t know how to
prove this directly from the differential equations…</p></li>
<li><p>Question 6. I was looking for something along the following
lines: Observe that <span class="math display">\[ \frac{dI}{dt} = bSI -
cI = b\left(S - \frac{c}{b} \right)I.\]</span> We know that <span
class="math inline">\(b &gt; 0\)</span>, so the sign of <span
class="math inline">\(dI/dt\)</span> matches the sign of <span
class="math inline">\(S - c/b\)</span>. Suppose <span
class="math inline">\(S(0) &lt; c/b\)</span>. Since <span
class="math inline">\(dS/dt &lt; 0\)</span>, we know that <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is monotonically decreasing, so <span
class="math inline">\(S(t) &lt; c/b\)</span> for all <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. Thus <span class="math inline">\(dI/dt
&lt; 0\)</span>, which means that <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>
is monotonically decreasing.</p>
<p>This analysis also tells us that, even if <span
class="math inline">\(S(0) \geq c/b\)</span>, as soon as we hit a time
<span class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(S(t_0) &lt; c/b\)</span>, the infected population
will decrease after <span class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span>.</p>
<p>It is also worth pointing out that you <em>cannot</em> conclude that
<span class="math inline">\(I = e^{(bS - c)t}\)</span>, since <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is itself varying with time! If you
differentiate <span class="math inline">\(e^{(bS-c)t}\)</span> with
respect to time, keeping in mind the chain and product rules, you find
that <span class="math display">\[ \frac{d}{dt}e^{(bS-c)t} = \left(b
\frac{dS}{dt} + (bS-c) \right) e^{(bS-c)t} \]</span> which shows that
<span class="math inline">\(I = e^{(bS-c)t}\)</span> does not satisfy
the differential equation that <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>
needs to satisfy.</p></li>
<li><p>Question 7. This is very confusing, so I didn’t take off any
points here no matter what you said. Probably when I revise this project
for the next time I teach ODEs I’ll add some hints about this. That
said, here are some thoughts.</p>
<p>First of all, notice that, in order for the units on the equation for
<span class="math inline">\(dS/dt\)</span> to work out, <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> needs to have units <span
class="math inline">\(1/(\text{people} \cdot \text{days})\)</span>.
Then, in order for the units on the equation for <span
class="math inline">\(dR/dt\)</span> to work out, <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span> needs to have units <span
class="math inline">\(1/\text{days}\)</span>. This means that the units
on the quantity <span class="math inline">\(c/b\)</span> is people.
(This makes some sense, since in the previous problem, we were comparing
<span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(c/b\)</span>. We know that <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> has units people, and a comparison
between two quantities only makes sense if the two have the same
units.)</p>
<p>But what number of people is <span
class="math inline">\(c/b\)</span>? Well, on a particular day, we have
<span class="math display">\[ c = \frac{\text{new
recoveries}}{\text{infected}} \]</span> and <span
class="math display">\[ b = \frac{ \frac{\text{new
infections}}{\text{susceptible}} }{\text{infected}} \]</span> which
means that <span class="math display">\[ \frac{c}{b} = \frac{ \text{new
recoveries} }{ \text{new infections} } \cdot \text{susceptible}.
\]</span> In other words, <span class="math inline">\(c/b\)</span> is
the answer to the following question: if all of the susceptible people
become newly infected on a particular day, how many people would recover
on that day?</p>
<p>Another interpretation for <span class="math inline">\(c/b\)</span>
falls out of the analysis we did in the previous question. More
specifically, <span class="math inline">\(c/b\)</span> marks a “critical
population” of susceptibles: the pointn when <span
class="math inline">\(S = c/b\)</span> is the point when the infected
population will start decreasing.</p>
<p>One final interpretation is that <span
class="math inline">\(c/b\)</span> is that this is some kind of a
measure of the virulence of the disease (or rather, non-virulence): as
<span class="math inline">\(c/b\)</span> decreases towards 0, the
infection spreads more and more rapidly. This is probably the easiest
interpretation to see, but it’s a little vague and the units of <span
class="math inline">\(c/b\)</span> are completely opaque in this
interpretation.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Part II
<ul>
<li><p>Question 3. The maximum infected population happens around <span
class="math inline">\(t = 7.1\)</span>, when the infected population is
about 273335. In other words, I was looking for something along the
lines of “around day 7.”</p></li>
<li><p>Question 6. 90% recovery happens somewhere between <span
class="math inline">\(t = 17.1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(t = 17.2\)</span>. In other words, I was looking
for something like “around day 17.”</p></li>
</ul></li>
