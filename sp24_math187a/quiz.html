<h2 id="general">General Information</h2>
<p>See the <a href="syllabus#quizzes">syllabus</a> for general
information about quizzes.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Resources: In general, the only resource you are allowed is one
two-sided handwritten sheet of notes on quizzes. In particular, no
calculators or computers are allowed; you should be prepared to have to
do a small amount of mental arithmetic.</p></li>
<li><p>Content: Quizzes will be cumulative, but the emphasis will be on
new material not previously tested. The content of the quizzes is
indicated below.</p></li>
<li><p>Format: In general, quizzes will take place in person during
class as indicated on the <a href="index#schedule">schedule</a>. You
will have 80 minutes.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Below you’ll find information about quiz corrections. Specific
information about particular quizzes (eg, any exceptions to the above
generalities) is noted further below.</p>

<h2 id="corrections">Quiz Corrections</h2>
<p>After each quiz (but not the final exam), you will be able to do
corrections to earn back some points that you missed. The maximum number
of points you can earn back is capped at 10% of the total number of
points on the quiz. You will earn back 0.5 points for each problem that
you “correct,” where correcting a problem means writing up thorough
responses to all of the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
<li>
What is the correct solution? (Write it out completely! Do not refer
back to your quiz.)
</li>
<li>
What specifically was incorrect about your solution on the quiz? What
are the key concepts involved in this problem that you didn’t understand
at the time?
</li>
<li>
What resources did you use to help you get to the correct solution?
</li>
</ol>
<p>You can use any resources you like (classmates, instructor, TA,
office hours, …) as long as you acknowledge them under item (c) as
indicated above, but your responses to all of the questions should
ultimately be written up in your own words.</p>
<p>Deadlines are indicated on the <a href="index#schedule">schedule</a>.
Submit your corrections through Gradescope. If you submit a single PDF,
please <em>make sure</em> to correctly “<a
href="https://help.gradescope.com/article/ccbpppziu9-student-submit-work">assign
pages</a>” to your submission.</p>
