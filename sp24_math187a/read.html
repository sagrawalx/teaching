<h1 id="reading-assignments">Reading Assignments</h1>
<h2 id="w1thu">Instructions</h2>
<p>These instructions are a little long, but <em>please read them
carefully</em>. It is your responsibility to know what’s written here to
ensure that you receive credit!</p>
<p>Reading Assignments (RAs) are labeled by a week number and a day. For
example, the first one is labeled “w1thu,” which is short for “Week 1
Thursday.” The RA label appears after a “/” in the <a
href="index#schedule">schedule</a> and links to a subheading on this
page. Each RA is due by 6:00am PT of the day indicated on its label
(which is early enough in the morning that you’ll most likely want to
complete it the day before!).</p>
<p>In order to complete your RA, you need to do two things:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Attempt to internalize the content of the indicated sections.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In other words, read through the indicated sections in the <a
href="/crypt/">notes</a> and attempt some of the exercises included
there.</p></li>
<li><p>We’ll discuss this content in class <em>after the RA
deadline</em>. Until then, you’re encouraged to chat with your
classmates and to supplement with any other resources. (Doing that is
part of <a href="syllabus#philosophy">the point</a>!)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Post a “Reading Question” (RQ) to our class <a
href="https://sunnysclasses.zulipchat.com/">Zulip stream</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The “topic” of a message that’s intended to be an RQ
<em>must</em> contain a label matching the regex
<code>\[w(\d+)(tue|thu)\]</code>, followed by something indicating what
your RQ is about. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>If your RQ for Week 1 Thursday is about exercise 2.3.1, you might
make the topic <code>[w1thu] exercise 2.3.1</code>.</li>
<li>If your RQ for Week 1 Thursday is about the masonic cipher, you
might make the topic <code>[w1thu] masonic cipher</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re starting a new topic for your RQ, make sure to follow these
rules!</p>
<p>If your RQ is a response in an existing topic that already contains a
valid label, no further action is required on your part: your response
will automatically count under the same label also.</p>
<p>If you notice that a topic is mislabeled, you can <a
href="https://zulip.com/help/rename-a-topic">rename the topic</a> to
correct it.</p></li>
<li><p>A <em>very strict</em> bot will tabulate credit for RQs. For
example:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you don’t follow the topic labeling instructions above
precisely, the bot might not recognize your post as an RQ and you won’t
get credit for it.</p></li>
<li><p>If you post even <em>one second</em> after the deadline, the bot
will mark it late and you won’t get credit for it.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Instructions for checking your RQ score with the bot will be made
available on our Zulip stream.</p></li>
<li><p>Your RQ message should show <em>sincere engagement</em> with the
relevant list of core ideas. Here is a non-exhaustive list of examples
of such things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Asking a question about something relevant that you found confusing
or intriguing.</li>
<li>Asking a question about, or sharing a possible solution to, one of
the exercises in the indicated sections.</li>
<li>Asking a question about, or sharing something about, how to use
software to do relevant computations.</li>
<li>Responding to a relevant question that someone else posted.</li>
<li>Sharing something relevant that you found confusing at first, but
then managed to figure out.</li>
<li>Summarizing the key ideas in the reading in your own words.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that you can <a
href="https://zulip.com/help/format-your-message-using-markdown#latex">typeset
math</a>, <a href="https://zulip.com/help/share-and-upload-files">upload
images</a>, and <a
href="https://zulip.com/help/format-your-message-using-markdown#code">share
code</a> in Zulip messages.</p>
<p>If your RQ is a question, formulate as <em>precise</em> a question as
you can. For example, if you’re asking about an exercise, say more than
just “I don’t know how to do this exercise.” Instead, share something
specific about what you tried and possibly also what went
wrong.</p></li>
<li><p>Questions that are not about the ideas in the relevant section
(eg, about class logistics) are very welcome on Zulip, but they
shouldn’t carry the square-bracket RQ labels. If I react to your
proposed RQ with an octopus emoji, it means your proposed RQ doesn’t
demonstrate sincere engagement and won’t count for credit as an
RQ.</p></li>
