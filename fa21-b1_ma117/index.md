# Details

## Week 1, Monday

* Introduction session (10:15am, Zoom link on Canvas)
    - The plan will be (a) for everyone to introduce themselves, (b) for me to say a few general words about class content and structure, and (c) for me to address any questions you all have about the course. 
    - I'll be joining via Zoom. You're all welcome (and encouraged!) to assemble in the classroom if you'd like to. I haven't seen the classroom, so I'll leave it to your collective best judgment to decide how to set up Zoom in the classroom in a way that makes sense.

        Note that the "extra" time is there in case you run into technical difficulties, eg with printing and/or scanning, or if you have accommodations with Accessibility Resources for extra time on quizzes. I entrust to the Honor Code that you'll actually spend 1 hour actually working on the quiz.
        
        You'll be able to download the template to see the problems, and you can either print out the template and work on the printout directly or work on your own sheets of paper. 
        
        You'll be allowed to use one handwritten sheet of notes. This quiz is designed to not require any calculation whatsoever, but you're welcome to use a calculator if you like. Those are the only things you are allowed to use.
