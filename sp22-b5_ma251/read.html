<h1 id="reading-assignments">Reading Assignments</h1>
<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>Each reading assignment has several parts:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Reading some material from the textbooks.</p></li>
<li><p>Attempting the “Comprehension Check” (CC) exercises listed below.
Submit your attempts through Gradescope. You’ll get credit for sincere
attempts; you don’t need to get answers correct. You can also check the
backs of the textbooks for solutions and/or hints to CC problems, but I
strongly encourage you to not check the back of the book until you’ve
made a serious attempt.</p></li>
<li><p>Participating on Discord in a way that shows that you sincerely
engaged with the reading. Here is a non-exhaustive list of a few ways
you might show this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask a question about something you didn’t understand in the
reading.</li>
<li>Share a CC problem you had trouble with, including something about
your attempt and where you think your attempt goes wrong.</li>
<li>Answer a question that someone else has asked.</li>
<li>Describe something you found confusing at first but then managed to
figure out.</li>
<li>Share something “from real life” (news, social media, books, comics,
jokes, etc) that’s related to the reading, with an explanation of how
it’s related.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<li>Topic: Induction, Prime Factorization</li>
<li>Read: <a
href="https://www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/BookOfProof/">Ham18</a>,
Chapter 10</li>
<li>CC: (Chp 10) 1, 9, 15, 25</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="w2thu">Week 2, Thursday</h2>
<ul>
<li>Topic: Euclidean Algorithm, Enumerating Primes</li>
<li>Read: <a href="https://wstein.org/ent/">Ste17</a>, chapter 1
<ul>
<li>Note: You’ve already seen many of the ideas in this reading. Focus
on the new stuff: computing gcds using the Euclidean algorithm (1.1.13),
the prime sieve (algorithm 1.2.3), and the (unproved!) statements of
Dirichlet’s theorem on arithmetic progressions (theorem 1.2.7) and the
prime number theorem (theorem 1.2.10). This might also be a good time to
look ahead at the extended Euclidean algorithm (algorithm 2.3.7).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>CC: (Chp 1) 1, 2, 3, 4, 8(b), 11
<ul>
<li>Note: For 3, give an elementary proof (ie, don’t just apply
Dirichlet’s theorem). For 4, you may use the “limit laws” that you
learned in calculus without proof (you’ll prove these when you take
analysis). For 8(b), there are a variety of approaches, but you might
try using lemma 1.1.17, similar to the proof of Euclid’s lemma (lemma
1.1.19).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="w2fri">Week 2, Friday</h2>
<ul>
<li>Topic: Divisibility Rules, Linear Congruences</li>
<li>Read: <a href="https://wstein.org/ent/">Ste17</a>, sections 2–2.1.1
and 2.3.1
<ul>
<li>Note: You’ve already seen the definition of congruences in <a
href="https://www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/BookOfProof/">Ham18</a>.
Focus on the new stuff: divisibility rules (eg, proposition 2.1.9),
solving linear equations (proposition 2.1.15), and modular inverses
(algorithm 2.3.8). These sections use words like “group,” “ring,”
“field,” etc. The terms are all defined in these sections, so do your
best to follow along, but there may be parts that you find confusing,
which is understandable. You’ll learn much more about these terms when
you go on to study algebra.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>CC: (Chp 2) 3, 7, 10</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="w3mon">Week 3, Monday</h2>
<ul>
<li>Topic: Binary Exponentiation, Euler’s Theorem</li>
<li>Read: <a href="https://wstein.org/ent/">Ste17</a>, sections 2.1.2,
2.2.1, and 2.3.2</li>
<li>CC: (Chp 2) 11, 15, 19(b), 30</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="w3tue">Week 3, Tuesday</h2>
<ul>
<li>Topic: Wilson’s Theorem, Chinese Remainder Theorem</li>
<li>Read: <a href="https://wstein.org/ent/">Ste17</a>, sections 2.1.3
and 2.2</li>
<li>CC: (Chp 2) 13, 17</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="w3wed">Week 3, Wednesday</h2>
<ul>
<li>Topic: Primitive Roots</li>
<li>Read: <a href="https://wstein.org/ent/">Ste17</a>, section 2.5</li>
<li>CC: (Chp 2) 23, 26, 31
<ul>
<li>Note: For 23, you <em>could</em> do this by trial-and-error, but I
suggest you do this systematically by finding all solutions modulo 5 and
modulo 7, and then using the Chinese Remainder Theorem to find
corresponding solutions modulo 35.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="w3thu">Week 3, Thursday</h2>
<ul>
<li>Topic: Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange</li>
<li>Read: <a href="https://wstein.org/ent/">Ste17</a>, sections 3–3.2
<ul>
<li>Note: The reading makes <em>brief</em> references to primality
testing and pseudoprimes. I think you don’t really need to know anything
about pseudoprimes or primality testing to follow along with the
Diffie-Hellman procedure, but you’re of course welcome to take a look at
section 2.4 if you’re curious!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>CC: (Chp 3) 4, 5</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="w3fri">Week 3, Friday</h2>
<ul>
<li>Topic: RSA</li>
<li>Read: <a href="https://wstein.org/ent/">Ste17</a>, sections
3.3–3.4</li>
<li>CC: (Chp 3) 2, 6</li>
