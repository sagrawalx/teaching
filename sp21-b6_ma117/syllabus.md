# Syllabus

> Statistical thinking will one day be as necessary for efficient citizenship as the ability to read or write.
> <span class="blockquote-attribution">—attributed to H. G. Wells[^attribution]</span>

[^attribution]: This appears to be a false attribution --- or rather, it is a paraphrase. In *Mankind in the Making* (1903), H. G. Wells writes 

	> The great body of physical science, a great deal of the essential fact of financial science, and endless social and political problems are only accessible and only thinkable to those who have had a sound training in mathematical analysis, and the time may not be very remote when it will be understood that for complete initiation as an efficient citizen of one of the new great complex world-wide States that are now developing, it is as necessary to be able to compute, to think in averages and maxima and minima, as it is now to be able to read and write.

	This was later paraphrased by Samuel S. Wilks in his presidential address to the American Statistical Association in 1950 in the form quoted at the top of this syllabus, and this paraphrase has spread under Wells's name since then. 

## Overview

MA117 is an introduction to statistics, the practice of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data. En route, the course will cover some concepts from probability which form the mathematical backbone of statistical analysis. The course will also involve using R, a programming language that statisticians use ubiquitously today. 

## Things you'll need

### Textbook 

We'll use an open-source textbook called [OpenIntro Statistics](https://www.openintro.org/book/os/). You can download a PDF from the website (for whatever price you like, including $0). You can also purchase a paper copy if you prefer. 

### RStudio 

We'll be using R for this course. There are two ways of doing this: 

* [Installing R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and then [installing RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) (in that order!), or 
* Using [rstudio.cloud](https://rstudio.cloud) in a browser. 

The latter is easier to set up. But, the last time I taught the class, a few students had some minor issues with rstudio.cloud that students using a desktop version didn't have. The issues didn't really impede students' ability to complete work (they just had to find some workarounds), and maybe rstudio.cloud has finessed these issues since then. In any case, my recommendation would be that you try to install RStudio on your computer if that's at all possible.

If you have trouble installing R and/or RStudio, your best bet is to get in touch with ITS for help. If that still doesn't work, you can use rstudio.cloud in browser, but just be aware that things might occasionally not work as you expect and feel free to ask for help when you need it. 

If you don't have access to a computer that you can use for R at all (ie, you can't install R + RStudio and you can't use rstudio.cloud in a browser), let me know and we'll try to figure something out.

## Mechanics

### Readings

The [calendar](index#calendar) indicates sections from the textbook for each day. You'll read those sections and then submit a "comprehension check" and a "reading question" by 8am MT on the day indicated on the calendar. 

* For the "comprehension check," you'll attempt to solve the [problems marked "CC"](index#readings-and-problems) from each section that you read. You'll get credit as long as I can see that you put in a sincere effort on these problems. You're encouraged to check your solutions for correctness yourself, by comparing against the solutions in the back of the textbook. 
    
* You'll formulate a "reading question" about what you read and submit it using a Google Form. Try to formulate questions as precisely as you can. If you didn't understand something in the reading, pinpoint exactly what it was that you didn't understand. If you couldn't solve a comprehension check problem, that could make for a good reading question as well; tell me what you got stuck on and why you got stuck. 

    If you don't have any questions about the reading, your question might be a non-question. For example, you might tell me about a question that you had but then managed to figure out. Or you might tell me about something that you understand but that you think your peers might find confusing. I'm mostly looking for an indication that you did the assigned reading and made a sincere attempt to process it.

Note that, depending on your time zone and sleep schedule, the 8am MT deadline might mean that you have to complete the assignment the day before the deadline indicated on the calendar. Deadlines will be strict, so please get things submitted on time. 

I will look through your questions and then make one or more short videos and/or documents summarizing what I think are the highlights from the reading and also trying to answer some of your questions. Please note that these videos are not intended to be substitutes for doing the reading! They'll just be discussions of a few important and/or confusing points from the reading. 

### Worksheets and Further Practice problems

There will be worksheet and/or further practice ("FP") problems associated to each reading. These will not be collected. That being said, some quiz and final exam problems will resemble these problems, so you are encouraged to do as many of them as you can. I also encourage you to work with your classmates on these problems. 

You'll find solutions to odd-numbered exercises in the textbook. I won't be posting solutions to the worksheets or the even-numbered exercises, but you're welcome to ask me or Fernando or Cinea or QRC tutors about anything you're struggling with!

### Quizzes and the Final Exam

There will be three quizzes and a final exam. 

The quizzes will be accessible to you through Gradescope 24 hours before their final deadlines (Fridays at 2pm). You are welcome to take the quiz at any time of day that works best for you. You are allotted 1 hour to work on quizzes. 

Note that, once you access the document through Gradescope, the website will be require you to submit your work within 3 hours (but it must be suubmitted before the 2pm deadline). I entrust to the Honor Code that you won't spend more than the allotted 1 hour on the quiz. The extra time is there for unusual situations (eg, if you run into technical problems in uploading your work, or if you've arranged for extra time accommodations with Accessibility Resources). Gradescope's 2pm deadline and 3-hour limit will be strict, so please make sure you get things in on time. 

The format for the final exam will be roughly the same as that of the quizzes, except it'll be roughly twice as long. You'll have 2 hours to work on it, and you'll have to finish submitting the file within 5 hours after you access the document (but still before the final deadline!). 

### Quiz Revisions

After the quizzes are graded, you'll have a chance to do some revisions. You can earn up to 2 points on your quiz by doing this, on any problem(s) you'd like. If you'd like to do this, send me an email within 72 hours after the quizzes are graded with the following information: 

* What problem(s) are you wanting to to revise? 
* Describe your mistake. What went wrong? Why did things go wrong? 
* What is the correct solution? Make sure to explain things fully. 

Also note that this is just for the quizzes; there won't be any revisions for the final exam. 

### Labs

There will be a number of labs over the course of the block. These will require you to use R to analyze some data and answer some questions. You should respond to each question as completely as you can. If answering a question requires you have to write some code that isn't explicitly given to you in the lab directions, include your code. If you generate a plot in the process of answering a question, include that plot. 

### Project

There will be a [project](project). The final product is due at the end of the block, but there will be some preliminary deadlines as well. 

### Self-reflection

Research in pedagogy shows that a key part of learning is taking the time to ask yourself questions about your learning. I'd like to encourage you to take the time to do this kind of reflection, and there will be a number of assignments throughout the course with this goal in mind. 

### Live events

There will be a few different types of live events: 

* Introduction session: This will happen only on the first day. It'll be a chance for all of us to see each other's faces, get to know each other, ask questions about the syllabus, etc. 

* Group sessions: Starting from 1st Tuesday, there will be a "group session" every day 10--10:30am MT (the end time is flexible). I've generated some random numbers to draw a set of names for each day. If your name is drawn on a particular day, you should show up on that day. You do not need to show up on other days (but you can if you like!). Things are set up so that your name should be drawn roughly once a week. 

    These group sessions are for you to talk to each other about whatever you're struggling with,  and I can chime in whenever necessary. This means that you should come with a question or two that you would like to discuss with the group! 
    
    If you won't be able to make it to a group session on a day that your name has been drawn for, please let me know in advance and we'll work something out. 

* Problem sessions: Fernando will hold problem sessions thrice a week. You might use these to talk to your classmates and to get help from Fernando on labs or whatever else you're struggling with! 

* Office hours: 
    - I'll have office hours for you to stop by and ask me for help with whatever you need. 
    - The math paraprof, Cinea, also holds office hours Monday through Friday, 9am--5pm MT. You should email her to let her know if there are things you'd like to ask her. 

I strongly encourage you to set up live study sessions with your classmates on your own as well. I've set us up a Slack workspace that you might use to coordinate live study sessions; you can also use it to ask each other questions via chat. It can be easy to feel isolated during this era of quarantines and social distancing, but you do have access to a community (which includes your classmates, me, Cinea, Fernando, and QRC tutors). Taking advantage of this community will help you feel less isolated, and also help your learning. 

## Assessment

Grades will be calculated as follows.

----------------------- ------
Reading questions       5%
Comprehension checks    5%
Reflection assignments  10%
Labs                    15%
Quizzes                 30%
Final exam              15%
Project                 10%
Participation           10%
----------------------- ------

Here are further details about some of these components. 

* *Reading questions*. You get 1 point for each reading question you submit, up to a maximum of $n-2$, where $n$ is the number of days a reading is assigned. In other words, you don't need to submit a reading question every day to get full credit, and there's no extra credit for doing so.

* *Comprehension checks*. You get 1 point for each problem you attempt, up to a maximum of $n-10$, where $n$ is the total number of comprehension check problems that are assigned. In other words, you don't need to submit comprehension checks every day to get full credit, and there's no extra credit for going above the requirements. 

* *Reflection assignments*. This is for all of the reflection assignments (mathematical autobiography, weekly reflections, etc). 

* *Participation*. You'll get a full score for the participation component of your grade as long as I can see that you are putting in a good faith effort to engage with the class. 

## Accommodations

If you anticipate or experience any disability-related barriers to your learning in this course, please discuss your concerns with me as soon as possible and we'll find a way to provide the accommodations that you need. Also, please contact the office of [Accessibility Resources](https://www.coloradocollege.edu/offices/accessibilityresources/) if you have not done so already.

## Covid-19

The Covid-19 pandemic challenges us as individuals and as communities in so many ways. If you find yourself faced with a challenging situation that might affect your classwork, please let me know and I'll do my best to accommodate your situation. Also know that a variety of offices on campus are available to help you through difficult situations. For instance, you might get in touch with the [Counseling Center](https://www.coloradocollege.edu/offices/counseling/), or with [Campus Safety](https://www.coloradocollege.edu/offices/campussafety/). You can get financial help through the [Coronavirus Emergency Fund](https://www.coloradocollege.edu/other/coronavirus/emergency-fund.html), and you can find more information and resources on the [Coronavirus Updates & Resources page](https://www.coloradocollege.edu/other/coronavirus/). 


## Honor code

Please make sure that you are familiar with the [Honor Code](https://www.coloradocollege.edu/other/honorcouncil/resources/student.html) at CC and that you abide by it. Violations of the Honor Code will have to be reported to the Honor Council, which is really no fun for anyone.
