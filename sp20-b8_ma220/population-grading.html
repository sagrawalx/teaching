<h1 id="population-project-grading">Population Project Grading</h1>
<p>Overall, I was very impressed with everyone’s reports for the <a
href="population">population project</a>! It seemed to me like you all
thought deeply about this population model and developed good intuition
about it.</p>
<p>The population project was graded out of 15 points. Here were the
common mistakes I noticed, together with how many points were deducted
for each of these mistakes. If you made a mistake that’s not on this
list, I’ll let you know specifically.</p>
<ul>
<li>2.1. There were two common mistakes here:
<ul>
<li>“Decline by 35%” means that the number gets multiplied by 0.65. If
you subtracted 0.35 instead of multiplying by 0.65, 0.5 points were
deducted.</li>
<li>If you noticed that <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> was not
invertible and used that to decide that <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span> cannot exist, 0.5 points were deducted.
Note that just because <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is not
invertible doesn’t mean that <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>
cannot exist! It just means that there isn’t a unique solution for <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>2.5. I was looking for something about how a dominant eigenvalue
greater than 1 result in growth (with faster growth as the eigenvalue
tends to infinity) and a dominant eigenvalue less than 1 results in
decline (with faster decline as the eigenvalue gets closer to 0). If you
didn’t say something along these lines, either 0.5 points or 1 points
were deducted (depending on how close you were).</li>
<li>3.1. It’s very tempting to decide that the first row of <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> should be the same as the first row of
<span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, and all entries of <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> below the first row should be 50% of
the corresponding entries of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.
This is incorrect, and can be demonstrated to be incorrect by playing
with some examples. The correct answer is that all entries of <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> are 50% of the corresponding entries of
<span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, <em>even the entries in the
first row</em>. If you made this mistake, 1 point was deducted.</li>
<li>3.3. The correct answer is roughly 23%. If you got something like
35%, you probably made the above-described mistake in Question 1, and no
further points were deducted.</li>
<li><ol start="4" type="1">
<li>I was just looking for some indication that you tried to play with
the simulation.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>If you only gave me code and didn’t describe in words how the
harvesting scheme works, 2 points were deducted.</p></li>
<li><p>If you’re curious about the harvesting scheme I came up with that
got me to retirement in 12 years, it’s the following: harvest 3% of
2-year-old fish and 100% of 3-year-old fish until I hit the point where
selling all my fish would allow me to retire, at which point I close up
shop by selling all my fish. To accomplish this, I replaced the “part
you want to edit” with the following:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode py"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="cf">if</span> money[t<span class="op">-</span><span class="dv">1</span>] <span class="op">+</span> population.dot_product(prices) <span class="op">&gt;</span> retirement:</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    current_harvest <span class="op">=</span> population</span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="cf">else</span>:</span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    harvest_rate <span class="op">=</span> diagonal_matrix([<span class="dv">0</span>,<span class="dv">0</span>,<span class="fl">0.03</span>,<span class="dv">1</span>])</span>
<span id="cb1-5"><a href="#cb1-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    current_harvest <span class="op">=</span> harvest_rate <span class="op">*</span> population</span></code></pre></div>
<p>However, this is not necessarily the best harvesting scheme out
there.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
