Everything is on [Canvas](https://canvas.coloradocollege.edu/courses/28957/) this time (for logistical reasons relating to the quarantine), except for:

* [Population project](population).
* [Final project](final-project). 

If you're not a member of the CC community and would like to know what's going on, you can take a look at the [webpage](/teaching/sp19-b8_ma220) for the previous time I taught this class, or you can reach out to me via email and I'll send you whatever you're looking for :)
