# Project

## Overview 

The purpose of this project is to give you the chance to use data analysis skills to investigate a topic that is of interest to you. You'll form groups of 3-5, decide on some questions that you can analyze using statistics, find or collect a suitable data set, conduct appropriate analysis on your data, and report your findings in two formats: a presentation, and a paper. 

The presentation and paper will both be due on the last day of class. Before then, you'll be asked to submit a proposal and then an outline, as indicated on the [calendar](index). Details about each of these components are given below. 

## Topic Proposal [3 points]

Decide on your group (3-5 people) and a topic you want to investigate. One person in each group should send me an email by the proposal deadline indicated on the [calendar](index) listing all the members of the group and the topic you've settled on. This will be brief: a few sentences at most. 

I encourage you to be creative and choose something that's interesting to you! Maybe you want to understand what attributes of a CC student's reading habits most influence their political opinions, or maybe you want to understand how a country's economy influences its performance in the Olympics, or... The possibilities are endless. Here are some [data sources](/teaching/data) if you need some inspiration, but don't feel like you have to use something off of this list; you can find data yourself, or you can decide to collect data yourself. 

## Outline [7 points]

The outline should be roughly one page, and can be written in bullet points. One person in each group should email me a PDF of your outline by the deadline indicated on the [calendar](index). You want to include enough detail here that someone could use your outline as a blueprint for replicating your statistical analysis. For example, you should address things like the following: 

* What specific hypotheses will you be testing? 
* How will you acquire the data you'll use? 
	* If you'll be using an existing data set, provide a link to the data set and a summary of how the data is structured. What variables are in the data set? What variables will be involved in your data anlysis? You might also want to look into how the data was collected. 
	* If you'll be collecting data yourself, describe your intended data collection process precisely. For example, if you'll be collecting data via a survey, you'll want to include the exact wording of your survey questions, and information about how you'll sample the population. Remember that you want to do your best to avoid sample biases, and to avoid questions which lead respondants to respond a certain way. 
* What statistical tests will you perform on the data to test your hypotheses? 

## Presentation [20 points]

On the last day of class, each group will give a 10ish minute presentation to the entire class. You'll want to share what topic you investigated, what hypotheses you tested, tables and/or graphics summarizing the data you used, what statistical tests you ran, and what the results of your tests were. Everyone should take an equal and active part in the presentation. 

## Paper [20 points]

On the last day of class, each group will submit a paper. You should write as succinctly as possible: be efficient with words. Also, your paper should follow the conventions of scientific literature and have the following components:

* Title, list of co-authors, and date of submission
* Abstract
	* The abstract is a clear and concise summary of the rest of the paper. It should be as brief as possible. Even though it shows up at the beginning of the paper, it will will probably be the last thing you write, since it's supposed to summarize the entirety of the paper. 
* Introduction
	* The introduction provides information that sets up the study. You want to state clearly what question you investigated and why it's important. If other people have done related studies, you want to describe what's been done and what's been found, and how your study fits in among these other studies (and remember to cite your sources clearly). You also want to state clearly what hypotheses you tested. 
* Methods
	* You want to include detailed information about how you acquired the data you used. You want to include enough information that a skeptical reader could replicate your study. If you used publicly available data, give complete references. If you collected data yourself, explain your data collection process in detail (if you used a survey, you can include a list of the precise survey questions in the appendix). 
* Results
	* You want to describe the results of your statistical analysis here. For example, this is where you would include tables and/or graphics describing the data. You also want to include information about statistical inference tests you ran, $p$-values, etc. This is the mathematical heart of the paper. 
* Discussion
	* This is where you want to thoroughly explain your results. What does your statistical analysis tell you about the question you were trying to answer? If something was contrary to what you expected, why do you think that happened? Were there any potential flaws in your methodology? There is some error in any study, so you want to think deeply about any possible errors that might have crept into yours. If you failed to find significant relationships, is it because they actually don't exist, or could there be other reasons? How might someone improve upon this study in the future? 
* References
	* Include complete references to all works you've used. They should be sorted alphabetically by last name. 
* Appendices
	* Anything that doesn't fit in anywhere else in the body of your paper, but that might help someone who wanted you replicate your study, should go in an appendix. For example, one appendix should include all of your R code (but you don't necessarily need to include all of the *output* of your code). If you collected data using a survey, the precise survey questions should be an appendix as well.
