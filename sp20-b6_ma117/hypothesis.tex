You want to know what percentage of books written by female authors in 2019 feature a female protagonist. You take a simple random sample and compute a 95\% confidence interval. Your confidence interval has a margin of error of 10\%. 

\mbox{}

\TF If you wanted your 95\% confidence interval to have a margin of error of 5\%, you would have to double your sample size.

\begin{frame}
\TF If we conduct 100 hypothesis tests with significance level 0.05, the expected number of times we expect to reject the null hypothesis is 5.

\probno A Rasmussen Reports survey of 1,000 US adults
found that 42\% believe that raising the minimum wage will help the economy. Do a majority of US adults believe that raising the minimum wage will help the economy?

\probno 400 students were randomly sampled from a large university, and 289 said they did not get enough sleep. Does this represent a statistically significant difference from 50\%?

\probno It is believed that nearsightedness affects about 8\% of all children. In a random sample of 194 children, 21 are nearsighted. Does this data provide evidence that the 8\% value is inaccurate?

\begin{frame}
\probno A study examined the average pay for men and women entering the workforce as doctors for 21 different positions.  If each gender was equally paid, then we would expect about half of those positions to have men paid more than women and women would be paid more than men in the other half of positions. The study found that, men were, on average, paid more in 19 of those 21 positions. Does this data provide evidence of a gender pay gap in medicine?

You are trying to decide whether or not a coin is fair. The null hypothesis is that it is fair. You flip the coin twice. 

\mbox{}

\TF It is impossible to reject the null hypothesis with significance level 0.05.

\probno The General Social Survey asked the question: ``For how many days during the past 30 days was your mental health, which includes stress, depression, and problems with emotions, not good?'' 

\mbox{}

Based on responses from 1151 US residents, the survey reported a 95\% confidence interval of 3.40 to 4.24 days in 2010. Interpret this interval in context of the data.
