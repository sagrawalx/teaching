# Reading Assignments

## Instructions {#w1wed}

These instructions are a little long, but *please read them carefully at least once*. It is your responsibility to know what's written here to ensure that you receive credit!

Reading Assignments (RAs) are labeled by a week number and a day; for example, the first one is labeled "w1wed," which is short for "Week 1 Wednesday." Each RA is due by 7am PT of the day indicated on its label. Each RA has three parts:  

1. Read the indicated reading material. 

    - The reading material will usually be from DVB (*Stats: Data and Models*, 5th edition, by De Veaux, Velleman, and Bock) or {{ os }} (*OpenIntro Statistics*, 4th edition, by Diez, Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Barr). Occasionally, you will be asked to read something different (either in addition or instead). 
    
    - We will discuss the content of the reading in class on the day indicated by the label. In particular, this means you will be submitting RAs *before* we've discussed this material together in class. Until then, feel free to chat with your classmates and to supplement your reading with any other resources you find. Doing all of that is part of [the point](syllabus#philosophy) of the RAs!
    
2. Submit the indicated Comprehension Check (CC) exercises through Gradescope. 

    - You'll get credit for *sincere attempts*. You don't need to get answers correct! If you find yourself very stuck, you can still demonstrate a sincere attempt by writing a few sentences explaining what you've tried, where you got stuck, etc. 
    
    - Conversely, you won't get credit if your work doesn't demonstrate a sincere attempt: leaving things blank or just drawing a giant question mark, transcribing solutions verbatim from the back of the book, etc.
    
    - The exercise numbers below always always refer to the end-of-section "Exercises," in both {{ os }} and DVB (in particular, they do *not* refer to the "Guided Practice" problems in {{ os }}).
    
    - There are also some Further Practice (FP) exercises listed below. These are optional and do not need to be submitted. They are recommended for additional practice, and exam problems might resemble some of these problems. 

3. Post a "Reading Question" (RQ) to our class [Zulip stream](https://sunnysclasses.zulipchat.com/). 

    - Your RQ should be something that shows sincere engagement with the content of the reading material. Here is a non-exhaustive list of examples of such things: 
    
        * Asking a question about something you found confusing or intriguing in the indicated sections. 
        * Asking a question about a CC exercise from the indicated sections that you struggled with.
        * Responding to a question that someone else posted about the indicated sections. 
        * Sharing something that you found confusing at first about the indicated sections but then managed to figure out. 
        * Sharing a list of what you thought were the salient points from the reading. 
    
        If your RQ is a question, formulate as *precise* a question as you can. For example, if you're asking about an exercise, say more than just "I don't know how to do this" or something like that; share something specific about what you've tried and what went wrong. Note that you can [typeset math](https://zulip.com/help/format-your-message-using-markdown#latex), [share code](https://zulip.com/help/format-your-message-using-markdown#code), and [upload images](https://zulip.com/help/share-and-upload-files) on Zulip.
    
    - To indicate that your Zulip post is intended to be an RQ, the "topic" for the post must contain the assignment label in square brackets, and should also include something to indicate about what your RQ is about. If your RQ is starting a new topic, make sure to follow these rules! 
    
        For example, if your RQ for Week 5 Monday is a question about the normal approximation for the binomial distribution, you might set the topic to something like `[w5mon] normal approx for binomial`. 
    
        If your RQ is a response to a topic started by someone else which already contains a valid square-bracket label, no further action is required on your part: your response will automatically count under the same label also. 
    
    - As mentioned earlier, your RQ must be something that shows engagement with the *content of the current reading*. You're certainly welcome to ask questions and make comments of other sorts on Zulip (eg, questions about class or exam logistics, or questions about previous readings), but please do not label them as RQs. If me or a TA reacts to your proposed RQ with an octopus emoji, it means your proposed RQ doesn't demonstrate sincere engagement with the content of the current reading and it won't count for credit. 
    
    - A bot will be used to tabulate credit for RQs. If you don't follow the topic labeling instructions above precisely, the bot might not recognize your post as an RQ and you won't get credit for it. Also, the bot will mark anything that comes in after the deadline as late, even if it comes in *just one second* after the deadline, so make sure to get things in on time! Instructions for checking your RQ score with the bot are [available on our Zulip stream](https://sunnysclasses.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/374026-Spring-2023.2C-Math-11/topic/.E2.9C.94.20TallyBot). 
    
    - Note that, if you start digging through the settings, you'll notice that Zulip gives you flexible privacy options regarding [who can view your email address](https://zulip.com/help/configure-email-visibility). You *must* make your email address visible at least to "Administrators" in order for us to be able to match your scores to you using your email address at the end of the quarter!
    
    - You don't need to post an RQ every time in order to get full credit on this portion of your grade. See the [syllabus](syllabus#grades) for details.
