<h1 id="reading-assignments">Reading Assignments</h1>
<h2 id="w1wed">Instructions</h2>
<p>These instructions are a little long, but <em>please read them
carefully at least once</em>. It is your responsibility to know what’s
written here to ensure that you receive credit!</p>
<p>Reading Assignments (RAs) are labeled by a week number and a day; for
example, the first one is labeled “w1wed,” which is short for “Week 1
Wednesday.” Each RA is due by 7am PT of the day indicated on its label.
Each RA has three parts:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Read the indicated reading material.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The reading material will usually be from DVB (<em>Stats: Data
and Models</em>, 5th edition, by De Veaux, Velleman, and Bock) or <a
href="https://www.openintro.org/book/os/">OS</a> (<em>OpenIntro
Statistics</em>, 4th edition, by Diez, Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Barr).
Occasionally, you will be asked to read something different (either in
addition or instead).</p></li>
<li><p>We will discuss the content of the reading in class on the day
indicated by the label. In particular, this means you will be submitting
RAs <em>before</em> we’ve discussed this material together in class.
Until then, feel free to chat with your classmates and to supplement
your reading with any other resources you find. Doing all of that is
part of <a href="syllabus#philosophy">the point</a> of the RAs!</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Submit the indicated Comprehension Check (CC) exercises through
Gradescope.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You’ll get credit for <em>sincere attempts</em>. You don’t need
to get answers correct! If you find yourself very stuck, you can still
demonstrate a sincere attempt by writing a few sentences explaining what
you’ve tried, where you got stuck, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Conversely, you won’t get credit if your work doesn’t demonstrate
a sincere attempt: leaving things blank or just drawing a giant question
mark, transcribing solutions verbatim from the back of the book,
etc.</p></li>
<li><p>The exercise numbers below always always refer to the
end-of-section “Exercises,” in both <a
href="https://www.openintro.org/book/os/">OS</a> and DVB (in particular,
they do <em>not</em> refer to the “Guided Practice” problems in <a
href="https://www.openintro.org/book/os/">OS</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>There are also some Further Practice (FP) exercises listed below.
These are optional and do not need to be submitted. They are recommended
for additional practice, and exam problems might resemble some of these
problems.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Post a “Reading Question” (RQ) to our class <a
href="https://sunnysclasses.zulipchat.com/">Zulip stream</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Your RQ should be something that shows sincere engagement with
the content of the reading material. Here is a non-exhaustive list of
examples of such things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Asking a question about something you found confusing or intriguing
in the indicated sections.</li>
<li>Asking a question about a CC exercise from the indicated sections
that you struggled with.</li>
<li>Responding to a question that someone else posted about the
indicated sections.</li>
<li>Sharing something that you found confusing at first about the
indicated sections but then managed to figure out.</li>
<li>Sharing a list of what you thought were the salient points from the
reading.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your RQ is a question, formulate as <em>precise</em> a question as
you can. For example, if you’re asking about an exercise, say more than
just “I don’t know how to do this” or something like that; share
something specific about what you’ve tried and what went wrong. Note
that you can <a
href="https://zulip.com/help/format-your-message-using-markdown#latex">typeset
math</a>, <a
href="https://zulip.com/help/format-your-message-using-markdown#code">share
code</a>, and <a
href="https://zulip.com/help/share-and-upload-files">upload images</a>
on Zulip.</p></li>
<li><p>To indicate that your Zulip post is intended to be an RQ, the
“topic” for the post must contain the assignment label in square
brackets, and should also include something to indicate about what your
RQ is about. If your RQ is starting a new topic, make sure to follow
these rules!</p>
<p>For example, if your RQ for Week 5 Monday is a question about the
normal approximation for the binomial distribution, you might set the
topic to something like
<code>[w5mon] normal approx for binomial</code>.</p>
<p>If your RQ is a response to a topic started by someone else which
already contains a valid square-bracket label, no further action is
required on your part: your response will automatically count under the
same label also.</p></li>
<li><p>As mentioned earlier, your RQ must be something that shows
engagement with the <em>content of the current reading</em>. You’re
certainly welcome to ask questions and make comments of other sorts on
Zulip (eg, questions about class or exam logistics, or questions about
previous readings), but please do not label them as RQs. If me or a TA
reacts to your proposed RQ with an octopus emoji, it means your proposed
RQ doesn’t demonstrate sincere engagement with the content of the
current reading and it won’t count for credit.</p></li>
<li><p>A bot will be used to tabulate credit for RQs. If you don’t
follow the topic labeling instructions above precisely, the bot might
not recognize your post as an RQ and you won’t get credit for it. Also,
the bot will mark anything that comes in after the deadline as late,
even if it comes in <em>just one second</em> after the deadline, so make
sure to get things in on time! Instructions for checking your RQ score
with the bot are <a
href="https://sunnysclasses.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/374026-Spring-2023.2C-Math-11/topic/.E2.9C.94.20TallyBot">available
on our Zulip stream</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Note that, if you start digging through the settings, you’ll
notice that Zulip gives you flexible privacy options regarding <a
href="https://zulip.com/help/configure-email-visibility">who can view
your email address</a>. You <em>must</em> make your email address
visible at least to “Administrators” in order for us to be able to match
your scores to you using your email address at the end of the
quarter!</p></li>
<li><p>You don’t need to post an RQ every time in order to get full
credit on this portion of your grade. See the <a
href="syllabus#grades">syllabus</a> for details.</p></li>
<li><p>For more information about Zulip, see the <a

<ul>
<li>This article is now about 20 years old, and it is directed primarily
at early <em>graduate</em> students in statistics. Nonetheless, it’s
worth reading and giving some thought to. Even if there are parts that
don’t feel directly relevant to you and your plans in life, might there
be some underlying principles that would be relevant for you? Bring some
thoughts along these lines to class with you!</li>
