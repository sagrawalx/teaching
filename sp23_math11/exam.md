# Exams

## Midterm 1 {#mt1}

The exam will take place during class and you will have 50 minutes. You will be allowed to use a *one two-sided handwritten sheet of notes*. No other resources will be allowed (in particular, no calculators). The exam will cover everything up through the w3wed reading on "Random Variables." There are 12 problems. The problems resemble CC problems, in-class problems, and/or FP problems. 

## Midterm 2 {#mt2}

The exam will take place during class and you will have 50 minutes. You will be allowed to use a *one two-sided handwritten sheet of notes*. No other resources will be allowed (in particular, no calculators). The exam cover everything up through the w7wed reading on "Inference: 1 Categorical Variable." There are 12 problems. The problems resemble CC problems, in-class problems, and/or FP problems. 

The exam is cumulative, but the emphasis is on newer material (ie, w3fri onwards). You will need to know how to calculate an antiderivative of a function of the form $f(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}$ (ie, the probability density function of an exponential distribution). Problems that involve calculations that require software or probability tables will be marked with an asterisk (*); since you will not have access to either, you will be asked to go as far as you can without software and then express your answer in terms of the functions in the following table:

<table id="cdf-table">
<tr>
<th>Distribution</th>
<th>Observation to percentile</th>
<th>Percentile to observation</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Standard Normal</td>
<td>`pnorm(-)`</td>
<td>`qnorm(-)`</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>T Distribution (`df`)</td>
<td>`pt(-, df)`</td>
<td>`qt(-, df)`</td>
</tr>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Chi-square Distribution (`df`)</td>
<td>`pchisq(-, df)`</td>
<td>`qchisq(-, df)`</td>
</tr>
</tr>
</table>

## Midterm Corrections {#corrections}

After each midterm, you can do corrections to earn back some points that you missed. The maximum number of points you can earn back is capped at 10% of the total number of points on the midterm. You will earn back 0.5 points for each problem that you "correct," where correcting a problem means writing up thorough responses to all of the following: 

<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
<li>What is the correct solution? (Write it out completely! Do not refer back to your midterm.)</li>
<li>What specifically was incorrect about your solution on the midterm? What are the key concepts involved in this problem that you didn't understand at the time?</li>
<li>What resources did you use to help you get to the correct solution?</li>
</ol>

You must respond to all three parts to receive credit. You can use any resources you like (classmates, instructor, TA, office hours, ...) to get to the correct solution, but your responses to all of the questions should ultimately be written up in your own words. 

Deadlines for corrections are indicated on the [schedule](index#schedule). Submit your corrections through Gradescope. If you submit a single PDF, you must correctly "[assign pages](https://help.gradescope.com/article/ccbpppziu9-student-submit-work)" to your submission.

## Final Exam {#final}

The exam will be virtual and asynchronous. 

### Logistics 

The exam will be available through Gradescope between Saturday 6/10 8:00am PT and Thursday 6/15 2:30pm. You can either print out the exam and work directly on it, or use your own paper. You must finish [submitting the exam through Gradescope](https://help.gradescope.com/article/ccbpppziu9-student-submit-work#submitting_to_your_assignment) within 3 hours[^osd] of when you first access the exam, or by Thursday 6/15 2:30pm, *whichever comes first*. 

If you like, you can read more about Gradescope's "timed assignments" [here](https://help.gradescope.com/article/ccbpppziu9-student-submit-work#understanding_timed_assignments). 

[^osd]: If you have arranged for extended time accommodations through OSD, Gradescope will automatically account for your multiplier, but you must still make sure to submit your exam by the Thursday 6/15 2:30pm deadline.

Late exams and exams sent via Zulip DM (or email or any other means) *will not be accepted*. It is your responsibility to situate yourself somewhere with a stable internet connection and to make sure that you give yourself enough time to scan, upload, and submit the exam. 

Please note that submission includes "assigning pages" if you [submit a PDF](https://help.gradescope.com/article/ccbpppziu9-student-submit-work#submitting_a_pdf) (this is not relevant if you [submit individual images](https://help.gradescope.com/article/ccbpppziu9-student-submit-work#submitting_an_online_assignment)). It is very important that you make sure to "assign pages" because the final exam will have to be graded on a time crunch; there won't be time to deal with regrade requests due to incorrectly assigned pages. 

[^assign]: "Assigning pages" 

Gradescope is scheduled to undergo [maintainance](https://gradescope.statuspage.io/incidents/jxtyttfs0076) on Sunday 6/11 8:00--8:30am PT. You will not be able to submit during this time, so please ensure that you do not start the exam at a time that would require you to submit during this maintenance window. 


### Resources

You are allowed to use *one two-sided handwritten sheet of notes*. No other resources are allowed.  

Software or calculators will not be necessary. Like on midterm 2, you will be asked to go as far as you can by hand and then express your answers in terms of the functions in the [same table](#cdf-table).

Please do not discuss exam problems with classmates who haven't yet taken the exam yet, either in person or online (eg, on Zulip). 

### Content

The exam will be cumulative. Material that hasn't occurred on any midterm so far (ie, w7fri onwards) will have a *slight* emphasis. Exam problems will resemble CC problems, in-class problems, FP problems, and/or previous midterm problems. There will be a total of 18 problems. 

Each problem will be worth 2 points. To ensure that you receive credit, you must *show your work and/or explain your answers* and you must *"assign pages" to your Gradescope submission*. Make sure also that you respond to the first problem on the exam, which will read as follows:

> **Problem 1.** Sign your name to indicate your agreement that you will not use any unauthorized resources (which includes everything except your two-sided handwritten sheet of notes) during this exam, nor will you provide any unauthorized aid to others. *If you skip this signature, you will receive a 0 on the entire exam!*
