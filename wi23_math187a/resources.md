Here is a list of some helpful links. If you find something else that should be on this list, please tell me about it! I would love to know what resources you're finding useful. 

You can find some cryptography-related SageCells on the [SageMath Wiki](https://wiki.sagemath.org/interact/cryptography). 

Here are some books about cryptography: 

* Hoffstein, Pipher, and Silverman. *An Introduction to Mathematical Cryptography*. 
* Goldreich. *Foundations of Cryptography I*. 
* Focca. [*Cryptology through History and Inquiry*](https://sites.wcsu.edu/mbxml/html/Intro_Crypto_Main.html). 
* Singh. *The Code Book*. 
* Stein. [*Elementary Number Theory: Primes, Congruences, and Secrets*](https://wstein.org/ent/).
* Menezes, van Oorschot, and Vanstone. *Handbook of Applied Cryptography*. 

Here are some other relevant books: 

* Diez, Cetinkaya-Rundel, and Barr. [*OpenIntro Statistics*](https://www.openintro.org/book/os/).
